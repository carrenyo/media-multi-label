tt6956148,Soft Water Hard Stone,Documentary,"Flavia Angelico, James Lloyd","Saskia Sassen, Richard Palmer, Newton Lima Azevedo, Jose Galizia Tundisi, Marussia Whately","With populations on the rise, present and future generations will search for solutions of how to deal with water crises in big cities. Soft Water Hard Stone is a heartfelt call to action on environmental and human issues and an investigation into the abuse of this most precious resource. The film bears witness to the most critical urban water crisis ever, in São Paulo Brazil, a metropolis with an exploding population of over 20 million people. From the toxic rivers turned into open sewers, to entire neighborhoods without water supply for weeks, the filmmakers portray every scene of this disturbing drama. Historical, political, financial and social issues are raised with clarity and sobriety. A profound dialogue among victims, scientists, influential leaders and decision-makers turns this complicated subject into a feature-length narrative that presents the facts through a dynamic construction of characters and their points of view. International figures such as Fulbright Scholar Richard Palmer and Saskia Sassen from Columbia University discuss, alongside representatives of the UN and the Brazilian Academy of Sciences, actual and future challenges. Public health experts and environmental activists expose the current situation and question the measures being taken, and ordinary citizens relate the terrible consequences of the crisis. Water shortages are becoming more frequent, green areas and water sources are vanishing and the mismanagement of solid waste and sewage is suffocating the rivers and reservoirs. While the politicians look the other way people are suffering. What can be done? More than a case study of a local problem, this film adds to a growing body of investigative documentaries that are facing up to the question on how humanity is dealing with what really matters: our survival.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGJiYzcxZjAtMjJhZS00MjJiLThlMDctOTFiYzM0YWM0ZDk3XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,Documentary,Documentary,Documentary,Documentary,4.43E-07,9.27E-07,1.23E-05,0.000115072,0.000258536,0.005829105,0.9386961,6.62E-05,1.62E-07,8.71E-08,0.000107378,0.000137885,0.000489944,7.04E-05,6.32E-05,0.04674443,1.50E-07,3.09E-05,4.71E-06,0.000784818,0.001964329,0.023170399,0.00491049,0.025736798,0.003763872,0.024583586,0.98911685,0.07686092,0.028012877,0.001956016,0.001919214,0.14895941,0.008512297,0.005613027,0.49216765,0.004972337,0.002177079,0.002443893,0.003943771,0.011167179,9.33E-08,8.20E-08,1.50E-08,3.51E-06,7.44E-12,2.06E-06,0.999998,0.00070534,1.69E-09,3.50E-12,2.18E-13,0.1075836,7.22E-08,2.23E-05,0.08990566,5.82E-11,1.74E-13,6.15E-08,1.16E-10,1.05E-07,5.30E-10,1.06E-05,8.41E-05,7.49E-07,3.09E-06,2.77E-06,0.9999999,1.56E-07,7.51E-07,4.68E-09,1.67E-08,5.46E-08,2.97E-07,1.43E-06,9.61E-06,2.02E-08,9.40E-11,0.001389146,1.89E-07,4.87E-07,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

tt1623777,Honest Man: The Life of R. Budd Dwyer,"Biography, Documentary, Drama",James Dirschberger,"Dyan Dwyer, Joanne Dwyer, R. Budd Dwyer, Robert Dwyer, Neil O'Neill","Honest Man: the Life of R. Budd Dwyer is a movie about politics and corruption, suicide and survival. Four years in the making, it explores the scandal that led an honest, hard-working man to take his own life. This independently produced feature-length documentary follows Budd Dwyer, a Pennsylvania politician who infamously committed suicide at a televised press conference. The film chronicles Dwyer's meteoric rise to political power and examines the bribery scandal and subsequent trial that pushed him to his breaking point. Honest Man also delves into the controversy and consequences of the uncensored airing of Dwyer's death on television stations worldwide. Honest Man reveals a story that has remained untold for over 24 years. The film features exclusive new interviews, including William Smith, the man whose testimony convicted Dwyer, and Dwyer's widow Joanne--her last interview before her death in 2009. Was Dwyer venal, or a victim? Did he kill himself because he couldn't live with being guilty, or because he couldn't live with being innocent? Honest Man allows audiences to judge for themselves.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzkxNzA3MDEyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjE1Nzg4NA@@._V1_.jpg,"Biography, Documentary",Documentary,Documentary,"Biography, Documentary, Drama",0.000139138,0.000295382,0.011250059,0.561437,0.007223933,0.24140957,0.9947883,0.002189592,0.005358867,0.000711946,0.000583523,0.18415257,0.000653038,0.007703327,0.19824193,3.08E-05,1.79E-06,0.001835152,0.000338267,0.007181066,0.001693964,0.006162886,0.002005873,0.31686747,0.007083444,0.1314399,0.9812107,0.052258532,0.006427817,0.000654939,0.000590414,0.04599464,0.002977996,0.005080873,0.038918704,0.002180356,0.000955666,0.001034615,0.006648342,0.009247042,6.19E-06,2.51E-09,5.07E-10,0.33397937,2.11E-07,0.06791316,0.9999933,3.79E-05,8.47E-07,1.00E-10,1.59E-11,0.001786276,5.11E-09,0.000118799,0.021831062,3.24E-10,2.33E-08,5.46E-09,2.42E-06,2.67E-08,7.47E-11,0.000210843,3.31E-11,0.9998908,1.53E-06,0.005116324,0.99994767,0.999579,2.80E-05,7.79E-12,5.26E-12,9.31E-07,2.10E-08,6.23E-11,2.42E-06,1.91E-09,1.82E-07,1.70E-10,8.13E-09,4.78E-09,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

tt18080094,Kino im Rausch: Die Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo,Documentary,Silvia Palmigiano,"David Bowie, Natja Brunckhorst, Uli Edel, Bernd Eichinger, Christiane Felscherinow","Als sich Christiane F. zu David Bowies Song ""Heroes"" einen weiteren Schuss Heroin setzt, schauen ihr 1981 allein in Deutschland fünf Millionen Menschen zu. Nie zuvor wurde Drogensucht und ihre Folgen filmisch so radikal umgesetzt. Wie konnte die Geschichte von einem minderjährigen Mädchen, das sein Leben an Drogen und Sex verliert, ein Meilenstein in Literatur und Kino werden? Als der Spielfilm ""Christiane F. - Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo"" 1981 seine Premiere in den deutschen Kinos feiert, kommen viele Menschen erschüttert aus der Vorführung. Nie zuvor wurden Drogensucht, Entzug und Prostitution so radikal dargestellt. Vor allem die Darstellerin Natja Brunckhorst und der Darsteller Thomas Haustein beeindrucken das Publikum nachhaltig. Es sind die 80er Jahre in West-Berlin; eine faszinierende Jugendkultur entwickelt sich in der Stadt, in der es weder eine Sperrstunde noch Grenzen zu geben scheint - obwohl sie eine meterhohe Mauer umgibt. Am Bahnhof Zoo - dem Zentrum West-Berlins - herrscht das Elend vor. Hier verbringen Drogensüchtige ihren Alltag, viele davon noch Kinder. Christiane F. ist eines davon. Sie erzählt zwei Journalisten ihre Geschichte. Schonungslos und ungeschönt. Das Buch wird ein Bestseller und kurz darauf wird daraus der erfolgreichste Film der 80er Jahre entstehen. Dem Spielfilm gelingt mit seiner radikalen Bildsprache und modernen Dramaturgie eine Rezeption bis ins Heute. Die Dokumentation geht der Frage nach, wie die Geschichte von einem Mädchen, das sein Leben an Drogen und Sex verliert, ein Meilenstein in Literatur und Kino werden konnte, und zeichnet den damaligen Zeitgeist nach. Nie zuvor veröffentliche Casting-Aufnahmen und Stimmen von einem Großteil der damaligen Crew wie dem Regisseur Uli Edel, dem Drehbuchautor Herman Weigel, dem Produzenten Hans Weth und dem Darsteller Thomas Haustein erzählen von den schwierigen Bedingungen bei den Dreharbeiten, von der Mitwirkung David Bowies und dem Umgang mit dem Erfolg.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjNkMGE0NTgtMzFlYi00ZDA1LThmN2UtOWU5NzRiYWQ1OWNmXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,Documentary,Documentary,"Biography, Documentary",Documentary,4.81E-07,0.001112624,8.67E-05,0.07259206,2.67E-06,0.005214531,0.99961346,0.054011777,0.00019992,3.02E-07,5.62E-06,0.008310406,2.71E-05,0.000228704,0.000640983,1.49E-05,2.13E-07,0.000682151,9.99E-06,0.000138441,0.001702616,0.015151399,0.003848692,0.059246756,0.021304734,0.003958956,0.9902964,0.021257171,0.023579622,0.001479806,0.002842337,0.03748721,0.43175617,0.002823681,0.013378837,0.01311729,0.001999997,0.001606648,0.00306632,0.011590822,3.00E-05,6.63E-07,1.19E-07,0.6380874,4.00E-09,0.001560786,0.9990582,0.03276213,3.68E-08,4.92E-10,5.86E-08,0.000303878,0.007703396,4.03E-07,1.02E-05,9.90E-07,3.64E-08,2.44E-08,0.000286715,1.17E-06,3.79E-10,3.11E-05,9.89E-05,1.07E-06,9.75E-07,1.16E-06,1,3.82E-07,1.94E-06,5.45E-09,1.70E-08,5.30E-08,4.93E-07,2.44E-06,4.19E-07,4.31E-08,1.08E-10,0.00384631,1.73E-07,3.08E-07,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

tt1370835,A Blooming Business,Documentary,Ton van Zantvoort,,"Flowers love people. Anyway, that is what the flower growing industry is trying to propagate. But whether flowers actually do love people, well, that remains the question. The largest percentage of flowers produced in third world countries, where the pay checks are low and the environment constraints are flexible, is auctioned in The Netherlands. ""A Blooming Business"" is a poetic documentary about people in Kenya who are imprisoned by the power of the global flower growing industry. The dilemmas of the industry grow painfully clear and a dark world of oppression, sexual abuse and terrible working conditions unfolds. There is only one conclusion possible: the smell of the imported rose is not sweet, but bitter. Pure observation goes unnoticed, hand in hand, with straightforward comments about life and living from the main characters throughout this film. The camera is present and absent at the same time. It reshapes the documentary. With great humanism, Van Zantvoort shows us literally and figuratively another world; a world in which the life of each human being is precious.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4NjQxODQ3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODMwMzk0OA@@._V1_.jpg,"Documentary, News",Documentary,Documentary,Documentary,6.11E-09,9.45E-08,3.42E-06,0.00047409,6.30E-05,0.000497331,0.9998946,0.00012095,2.05E-06,1.48E-08,8.29E-09,0.015410503,8.51E-07,1.40E-05,0.9244533,1.52E-07,8.05E-11,2.33E-05,3.18E-07,1.12E-05,0.001417006,0.01434907,0.003336677,0.01878138,0.004521303,0.036949266,0.9895471,0.055087823,0.019550707,0.001468853,0.00145362,0.08950489,0.005967175,0.004426726,0.33030412,0.004992821,0.001535324,0.001313092,0.002463719,0.00972369,8.12E-08,2.14E-06,1.90E-09,4.14E-05,6.95E-08,4.80E-06,0.9999976,1.27E-06,8.79E-10,5.77E-13,3.99E-11,0.011018418,6.03E-06,8.72E-09,0.43332478,5.74E-07,9.66E-11,1.10E-07,2.83E-12,7.25E-10,8.17E-11,1.35E-05,3.87E-05,3.37E-06,5.56E-07,2.63E-06,1,1.16E-07,2.17E-07,7.54E-10,1.65E-09,3.55E-08,1.86E-07,2.94E-07,1.41E-05,1.92E-09,1.09E-11,0.000600124,1.61E-07,1.01E-07,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

The narrator tries to communicate with his unborn son and takes off on a journey were you see faces of apparitions of those outcasts, who find their solace of living only in the shadows; outside, but beside, the political and economical system; system that kills the individual and creates masses instead. These outcasts are bums, cripples, madmen, lunatics. They, in the eyes of the narrator, are the only ones, that know what it means to be human. They are not corrupt by the masses or the system; they are so overwhelmed by their madness or dreams, that they have lost the relationship with the world. They live in a world of their own, thus enabling freedom from the system. What they do, is wait.

With limited speech, Tracy Thresher, 42, and Larry Bissonnette, 52, both faced lives of mute isolation in mental institutions or adult disability centers. When they learned as adults to communicate by typing, their lives changed dramatically. Their world tour message is that the same possibility exists for others like themselves. At each stop, they dissect public attitudes about autism and issue a hopeful challenge to reconsider competency and the future. Along the way, they reunite with old friends from the USA, expand the isolated world of a talented young painter and make new allies in their cause.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3MTIzNTQ2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzQ2ODA2NA@@._V1_.jpg,Documentary,Documentary,Documentary,"Biography, Comedy, Documentary",1.16E-05,0.000488718,0.00160938,0.004901806,0.000118927,0.008570708,0.99999416,0.007731956,0.001256507,3.01E-06,5.06E-07,0.001678566,2.25E-06,0.000889838,0.000658397,3.00E-07,1.02E-09,2.49E-05,0.010250358,2.46E-07,0.001053362,0.010006143,0.003800297,0.072704986,0.030659292,0.005708984,0.99512094,0.08844637,0.032178238,0.00102771,0.001004064,0.025467297,0.005995352,0.00202974,0.031705823,0.003751052,0.001306657,0.001230698,0.00235956,0.004375447,3.41E-06,2.46E-05,1.16E-08,0.0345771,0.000928285,7.35E-08,0.99973553,3.01E-05,0.000155255,2.03E-10,6.59E-09,2.34E-05,3.13E-08,6.71E-06,0.042299896,2.78E-07,8.69E-07,1.08E-06,0.001540363,6.05E-06,6.64E-09,5.90E-05,1.96E-07,0.99889106,0.9966605,2.53E-05,0.9999989,2.80E-07,3.31E-07,8.07E-09,7.43E-13,9.43E-09,1.83E-06,1.24E-12,1.38E-07,9.96E-13,1.02E-07,1.38E-09,1.92E-08,8.03E-10,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

tt14049156,Friends of the Ghetto,Documentary,Tomas Vynikal,,"The young director Tomas Vynikal arrives at the Roma ghetto in search of humanity. With an authentic approach, he finds true friendship, but also human corruption. Everything is kept in the dark when the city of Prerov sells the ghetto together with its inhabitants to a private company for the purpose of new housing construction. This company will only go so far to demolish part of the houses and end up insolvent. The work is also a picture of current social problems in the Czech Republic, where human dwellings are meaninglessly devastated. These inhabitants receive new rental flats from the state, thus another ghetto is being created and society is moving in a catch 22 circle. The film contains time spent from September 2010 to September 2020. The documentary is the feature debut of Tomas Vynikal. This is a fully independent film without state nor commercial support.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWJmNzZiNmEtZjNhNS00YmI4LTg2ODAtZjFiYmZmMjE5OTA1XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,Documentary,Documentary,Documentary,Documentary,4.95E-05,0.00082428,0.000964194,0.03428083,0.000509667,0.3280282,0.99986386,0.021097152,0.000449878,4.48E-05,1.04E-05,0.000601888,0.000181801,0.01046917,3.37E-05,0.000110362,5.36E-06,0.000186742,0.000757358,7.56E-07,0.000776968,0.011930397,0.00331884,0.047445536,0.020538907,0.0274153,0.992257,0.10759824,0.017378643,0.001190263,0.000832053,0.057966437,0.004497964,0.002932502,0.06493116,0.005025865,0.001709207,0.00090266,0.001157654,0.004874314,5.71E-12,1.45E-07,3.90E-10,3.91E-09,1.92E-07,8.65E-10,0.9999995,0.002209982,7.01E-08,1.13E-12,3.70E-13,8.06E-10,2.41E-19,1.78E-13,1.95E-08,2.27E-09,5.35E-11,7.17E-08,5.37E-12,7.32E-11,1.38E-09,5.00E-05,0.000293822,1.86E-06,7.85E-06,9.83E-07,0.99999964,1.06E-07,1.20E-06,2.32E-08,5.74E-08,5.48E-08,5.50E-07,7.50E-07,6.53E-07,4.88E-08,4.65E-10,0.002099504,2.64E-07,4.21E-07,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Over the course of three years, Los Angeles documentary filmmaker Constance Jackson went to Holtville to interview dozens of people--including family members of the teenagers involved--in an attempt to somehow make sense of this senseless act. Through interviews, re-enactments, dramatizations, animation, media coverage, and family archives, Blitz Attack: The Andrea Hines Story is a compelling and detailed account of the history leading up to this horrific tragedy and enduring legacy.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2Q4Y2ZiMzctYjE5ZS00MThkLWI2OWQtNTY3NThmMzUzZDBiXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,Documentary,"Crime, Documentary","Crime, Documentary","Biography, Crime, Documentary",6.13E-06,0.000478193,4.44E-05,0.47991335,4.46E-06,0.031023866,0.998718,0.06681447,0.002590581,6.42E-06,3.18E-06,7.05E-05,1.14E-05,0.00031768,0.012341801,3.36E-06,4.77E-07,5.02E-05,0.005428949,2.00E-05,0.002932518,0.009394569,0.005621186,0.115130015,0.011550498,0.7256747,0.9662901,0.055690046,0.009242658,0.002284377,0.001664474,0.029246805,0.003746948,0.014731755,0.048360478,0.007538097,0.002476436,0.001839366,0.010313886,0.012169558,1.82E-09,5.70E-07,4.04E-14,0.005264267,4.02E-09,0.57503915,0.99999976,2.09E-07,3.98E-08,5.13E-13,1.94E-14,5.61E-07,1.99E-11,0.000664189,0.000269007,4.92E-09,9.31E-10,5.92E-08,2.93E-11,7.94E-12,1.16E-11,3.73E-08,1.10E-09,0.99921167,1.69E-05,0.9999925,0.99999774,8.73E-07,1.72E-08,1.43E-15,2.34E-15,1.62E-07,1.90E-07,6.32E-09,9.92E-07,2.42E-11,5.16E-10,1.07E-10,2.45E-07,2.94E-10,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

tt4386134,Old Fashioned: The Story of the Wisconsin Supper Club,Documentary,Holly De Ruyter,"Terese Allen, Brenda Bredahl, Jim Draeger, Don Levin","Supper club restaurants were the hot dinning trend in the mid twentieth century. They provided a place for people to spend their evenings enjoying cocktails, home cooked, high quality food and entertainment. The supper club scene slowly faded from the rest of the country, but kept a strong hold in Wisconsin due to a culture that allowed it to thrive. Around for decades, supper clubs in Wisconsin have been able to hold their own style and traditions. While chain restaurants continue to expand and threaten their future, supper clubs are fighting to survive while continuing to offer the same exceptional dinning experience and a personal touch that is not seen in the modern lifestyle of dine and dash.

Rachel is considered one of the biggest names in national literature. The writer was a novelist, translator and chronicler of newspapers and magazines, an innovative fact at the time, since most women did not have access to education and literature. The writer had her name highlighted in the social fiction of the Northeast. Her work ""O Quinze"" was known throughout the country for showing the struggle of the Northeastern people against drought and misery that plagued this Region in 1915. In addition, she wrote children's literature, anthologies and plays. Among her works are: Memorial of Maria Moura, Dora Doralina, The three Maria, Mandacaru, Menino Mágico, among others. Rachel de Queiroz was the first woman to be a member of the Brazilian Academy of Letters (ABL), where she occupied chair number 5.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzEzNTU0OTktMTY4Ni00ODE1LTk1MmEtNmNkOTU2N2U5Yzg4XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,"Biography, Documentary","Biography, Documentary","Biography, Documentary","Biography, Documentary",2.35E-07,0.001755664,0.000132266,0.5741935,6.94E-07,0.003684623,0.9999778,0.02598914,0.00091299,5.52E-07,3.09E-08,0.17383945,0.00845987,0.00087976,0.000162502,1.08E-05,2.53E-08,0.000187905,1.56E-06,3.76E-06,0.002040526,0.006351976,0.002567122,0.6877939,0.008769446,0.014157431,0.9759276,0.08917266,0.010440873,0.00087921,0.000929482,0.11510106,0.011611494,0.003958044,0.01322561,0.001929523,0.001167377,0.001292077,0.009151043,0.00598348,4.01E-05,1.57E-06,1.15E-10,0.95371604,0.007936249,1.82E-06,0.94030166,6.28E-05,3.16E-08,1.05E-06,1.06E-10,0.04773661,7.15E-05,4.12E-05,0.00068534,1.26E-09,1.20E-08,0.002082984,5.98E-08,0.000243468,6.48E-09,0.000105066,1.51E-08,0.9999982,3.61E-06,0.00088313,0.99990046,2.57E-05,8.45E-06,6.88E-11,2.98E-11,9.61E-07,3.75E-05,2.15E-10,9.79E-06,1.39E-09,2.63E-08,2.27E-08,3.61E-06,4.49E-07,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

tt2953170,Pussy Riot: The Movement,"Crime, Documentary, History",Natasha Fissiak,"Mariya Alyokhina, Diana Arbenina, Artour Aristakisian, Svetlana Bakhmina, Veronika Dolina","Pussy Riot - The Movement briefly reviews the events that led to the harsh two-year sentences of Pussy Riot members for singing a punk rock song in Moscow's most important cathedral. Their message about the growing repression in Russia by Putin's regime caught the world's attention like no other dissidents before them and turned the avant garde feminist collective into a worldwide symbol of freedom. The film goes beyond the trial, to the women's prison experiences. The film crew is embedded in a violent demonstration that produces stunning footage. Included are exclusive interviews with Katia Samutsevich, the Pussy Riot member who was released; families of the women; famed Russian journalist, Masha Gessen; artists; and dissidents. Also included is a trip to the penal colony where Nadia Tolokonnikova was being held. Pussy Riot - The Movement explores the questions: Where are the freedoms guaranteed in the Russian Constitution? Is Putin writing his own ""amendments"" to the Constitution? Why doesn't the Constitution work?"" Has Pussy Riot had a lasting impact on the fight for freedom in Russia?

In less than 15 years, he left his indelible mark on the collective unconscious of the French. Because Coluche had the power to make people laugh and to change the world.

tt0807851,Out of Faith,Documentary,Lisa Leeman,,"OUT OF FAITH, a feature-length documentary, follows three generations of a family being torn apart by conflicts over interfaith marriage. The family's matriarch, Leah Welbel, and her husband Eliezer, both survived over two and a half years in Auschwitz; however, in their minds, their grandchildren marrying non-Jews represents a posthumous victory for Hitler. As filming for OUT OF FAITH commences, Leah and her first grandchild to ""marry out,"" Danny, have not spoken for six years. When her second grandchild, Cheryl, marries a Christian, Leah takes a different approach: she showers her with love and attention, hoping that by keeping the lines of communication open she will be able to convince Cheryl's husband, Matt, to convert to Judaism. Cheryl resists: ""I would like a Jewish family, but I'm certainly not going to impose on Matt and push all these things on him, because that's the worst thing you can do in a relationship. Because I know if he said to me, 'Cheryl, I want you to convert to Christianity,' I'd say 'take a hike!'"" OUT OF FAITH follows the Welbel family for three years as they try to resolve these issues. The pressure mounts on Cheryl as people tell her that interfaith marriage is decimating the Jewish population; and pressure mounts on Leah as her grandson's wife is about to have a baby - Leah's first great-grandchild. Will Leah and Danny reconcile? Can Leah continue to engage Cheryl without giving in to her belief that by doing so she is ""betraying her family"" murdered in the Holocaust? An unexpected family event changes everything. OUT OF FAITH examines the complex and emotionally charged issues surrounding assimilation and interfaith marriage. It captures the intimate details of one family's attempt to persevere in the face of a heart wrenching intrafamilial conflict; a conflict that impacts countless families in multicultural societies that have intense pressures to assimilate.

tt0198242,Split Second,"Family, Game-Show",Henry Pasila,"Monty Hall, Sandy Hoyt, Sharolyn Sparrow","As was its 1970s predecessor, ""Split Second"" was a fast-moving game show where three contestants, one a returning champion, competed to answer general knowledge questions and win cash. Host Hall announced a category (e.g., ""Female Music Video Stars"") and a question relating to the category (""Who was the star of the following music videos?""); the players were shown three clues (""Like a Virgin,"" ""Girls Just Want to Have Fun,"" ""Who's Ever in New England""). All three contestants rang in, the one who rang in first having the first chance to select a clue and provide an answer. If he was right, he won a share of the pot; his/her opponents could answer two or possibly all three questions. Players were rewarded based on their ability to answer $10 each if all three contestants provided one right answer; $25 if two of them were right; and $50 if just one answered all three questions correctly (by the way, the correct answers were, in order, Madonna, Cyndi Lauper and Reba McEntire). After an undefined time limit, dollar values were doubled (i.e., $20, $50 and $100). In the game's final round, contestants were seeded based on their score up to that point the player in the lead needing four correct answers to become champion, second place requiring five and third place requiring six; ties required the players to answer the lesser of the required number of questions. The player who met his/her requirements first was the day's winner. That player moved on to the bonus round, played one of two ways: 1. The player chose three of five screens; if they all read ""CAR,"" they won that prize and left undefeated; otherwise, they won a ""FUR"" or a ""TRIP"" and returned to the next show. 2. The player chose one of five screens; if it said ""CAR,"" they won the car and retired undefeated; otherwise, it was $1,000 and a return to the next show, with a championship win meaning improved odds. Five-time champions retired undefeated and won a new car.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGEyOTA2MWYtNjg5My00MTRhLWFmZmQtNTE1ZDE1YTFhYzJiXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,Game-Show,Game-Show,Game-Show,"Family, Game-Show",0.000384971,1.02E-07,7.09E-09,2.21E-08,0.018996561,3.01E-08,2.06E-06,6.95E-10,0.01118842,4.97E-06,0.9885793,2.35E-09,0.005019116,5.69E-10,7.21E-06,2.93E-06,4.73E-07,1.94E-10,0.003623851,0.06730665,0.011007781,0.02507624,0.006943805,0.007488774,0.15497038,0.003514424,0.019323234,0.014521872,0.11314952,0.007164783,0.9589543,0.007089779,0.06367639,0.004677587,0.009751583,0.09307173,0.013755253,0.003870119,0.011119925,0.014550683,2.44E-07,8.42E-14,7.03E-18,1.30E-17,0.00056541,1.04E-19,6.86E-13,9.54E-20,0.20377865,2.26E-17,0.99999976,8.18E-18,9.46E-08,1.73E-15,1.91E-16,9.20E-11,1.47E-17,1.57E-20,2.01E-10,1.10E-11,3.87E-06,2.41E-07,8.97E-10,4.14E-09,0.003936688,3.57E-11,0.000117769,2.62E-07,0.9999783,2.19E-06,0.9999809,9.11E-11,5.72E-07,3.12E-12,9.50E-07,3.37E-08,5.35E-08,2.17E-08,1.44E-07,2.61E-07,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

tt0107547,My Private War,Documentary,"Harriet Eder, Thomas Kufus",Erich von Manstein,"Late in the 1980s, two documentary film makers found six German men, all in their 60s and 70s, who had been soldiers in the German invasion of the USSR in 1942. Each carried an 8mm camera into battle and they still had their film. ""Mein Kreig"" alternates between interviews with these older men, now apologetic, philosophical, or defiant about their participation, and the footage they shot. It's chronological: basic training, the train trip East, roof-top vistas of war-torn Warsaw, peasants in Belarus, the downing with carbine volleys of a Russian plane, winter, a holiday at the Black Sea, mud, impassable roads, death, destruction and retreat.

Abducted by a sadistic predator and his wife, she was brainwashed, tortured, and largely confined to a coffin-size box. Taking us back to where it all happened, Colleen Stan bravely documents her terrifying captivity. From the very spot where she was first picked up, Colleen provides a riveting first-hand account. She explains how a slavery contract prevented her from running, and how mind control prevented her from going to police even once she was free. In the second hour learn how Colleen embraces freedom, but no matter how much she wants to move on, the past won't go away. When she eventually took the stand at her abductor's trial, she found herself portrayed as a willing participant. Evil may cast a long shadow, but faith and family ultimately allowed Colleen to reclaim her identity and find her mission. There was another kidnapping victim-one who died and was never found-and now Colleen is determined to find justice for her, too.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzAwN2RiYTUtZmUzOS00NjU5LTg2YzctYTFlOTE3N2NkZGEwXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,Documentary,Documentary,Documentary,"Documentary, Drama",6.14E-05,0.001587872,0.000391582,0.03744856,0.00438025,0.002916509,0.9999697,0.000334132,0.007054243,3.11E-05,0.000107583,0.000987163,0.38436022,0.000299634,3.79E-05,3.05E-05,2.48E-07,2.14E-05,0.000117717,3.41E-06,0.001272616,0.008489192,0.002967196,0.21224774,0.010916946,0.06453353,0.9958501,0.07588437,0.011817101,0.000742073,0.000819876,0.04380828,0.005160891,0.003920782,0.013432039,0.003164556,0.000974377,0.001040533,0.003138912,0.003231592,0.001284668,3.00E-05,4.04E-06,0.12969947,3.69E-07,0.30765086,0.99871576,0.001096772,3.69E-05,1.81E-07,1.07E-08,0.010149442,0.000134106,0.000970074,0.008441958,4.79E-06,1.41E-07,4.49E-06,0.000139325,6.82E-07,2.18E-11,8.53E-05,1.45E-09,9.58E-06,3.11E-05,0.019586835,0.9999931,0.9999502,8.75E-05,1.73E-10,1.28E-09,6.41E-08,3.86E-11,7.61E-08,4.45E-07,2.57E-07,1.47E-07,4.51E-08,6.52E-10,8.12E-09,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

This short video critically examines Trump's actions and statements that have negatively impacted Black Americans, from his support of stop-and-frisk programs and encouragement of police brutality, to judicial appointees that have blocked DEI initiatives and gerrymandered maps. He has supported economic policies that have disproportionately impacted Black communities and used mocking language that paints Black people as criminals. Our video makes the case that Trump has been anything but an ally to Black Americans. ''What do you have to lose?'' he asks Black voters. This video provides the answer.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzBmZWE5NzItODExMS00M2E5LTk0ZDktY2Y5NTQyMWNmOTllXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,"Documentary, News",Documentary,"Crime, Documentary","Biography, Documentary",4.69E-10,2.23E-09,1.08E-05,0.000147984,0.016156677,0.031881835,0.97312486,0.000380138,1.76E-06,2.66E-07,1.36E-07,0.026340531,9.45E-08,4.42E-05,0.90494615,1.20E-05,1.91E-09,1.02E-05,8.31E-09,7.10E-06,0.001245569,0.007304849,0.002452727,0.33504134,0.013142436,0.02893494,0.9889159,0.061002165,0.007751087,0.000910589,0.000508476,0.18749607,0.007003689,0.004675869,0.1118704,0.001734297,0.001456294,0.00142474,0.002301873,0.013910154,2.32E-07,3.80E-09,4.51E-09,0.00647687,1.25E-05,0.81157327,0.998014,9.59E-06,2.57E-07,1.25E-10,2.42E-11,0.000622134,1.70E-08,1.41E-05,0.001569076,5.08E-07,5.09E-10,2.93E-07,2.19E-10,1.37E-07,6.96E-09,7.41E-05,4.46E-08,0.999966,3.62E-05,0.042242583,0.99999464,3.77E-06,4.01E-06,5.67E-11,3.39E-11,2.18E-07,4.57E-05,1.62E-09,1.24E-05,6.97E-10,5.57E-09,1.06E-07,1.16E-05,1.41E-06,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

tt12798518,Rescue Story - Saving Companion Animals,Documentary,Daniel Gartzke,"Jamie Baldwin, Lisa Bockholt, Breton Courtney, Ashley Dionne, Paul Duey","Rescue Story, addresses the problem that 1.5 million animals are euthanized in the United States every year. (ASPCA) This is principally caused by the over-crowding of traditional shelters, the under-funding of traditional shelters, along with those shelters being required (often by law) to take animals, the lack of outlets for animals who are struggling to find homes, the difficulty placing animals with special needs, and lack of time, resources, and raining in traditional shelters to overcome these needs, and by people acquiring animals from pet stores / puppy mills instead of adopting a rescue. In the film we show that there are many solutions to this national issue. We educate the audience by showing how increasing funding for traditional shelters when possible can make a huge difference. Not only that, but organizations can encourage training shelter employees to deal with troubled animals, making them easier to adopt. We also encourage people to adopt animals from shelters, rather than turning to breeders and puppy mills. Our film follows the lives of several different pets and along the way meet tremendous stories of triumph and of tragedy for these rescued animals. We visit municipal shelters, pet stores, non-profit organizations, animal sanctuaries, prisons and follow the stories of individual pet owners to show the radical way animals are treated, as well as the radical ways they change their owners' lives.

tt2318645,Raid of the Rainbow Lounge,"Crime, Documentary, History",Robert L. Camina,"Meredith Baxter, Christopher Aller, Thomas R. Anable, Joel Burns, Todd Camp","A full length documentary film recounting the events surrounding the widely publicized and controversial raid of a Fort Worth, Texas gay bar in 2009.

One of the reasons for this high rate is breech presentation. During pregnancy, babies move freely until the last trimester, when they tend to settle head down. Babies that do not are in a breech presentation. Until recently, these babies could be delivered vaginally or by cesarean section. Today, very few women experience vaginal breech delivery as an option. Heads Up, a short documentary by Elliot Berlin and Melissa Kennedy, explores the history of breech delivery options. The film highlights the plight of women who would like, or would have liked, the option for vaginal breech delivery and follows several women who fought for that choice.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMDc1MzA1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzUzNTE5NTE@._V1_.jpg,,Documentary,Documentary,"Documentary, News",7.13E-09,1.05E-08,7.65E-05,4.98E-05,0.32541347,7.23E-07,0.31098083,5.12E-05,1.33E-05,3.32E-06,7.07E-06,0.000991381,9.79E-05,4.62E-08,0.01902862,2.01E-06,3.66E-08,1.43E-06,3.41E-06,0.005182446,0.000928173,0.006338844,0.001540638,0.00820717,0.006869312,0.007306458,0.960935,0.023496512,0.014290058,0.000917993,0.001045727,0.011853098,0.004457133,0.001139161,0.1886011,0.013637836,0.001134127,0.000561277,0.00204815,0.007351955,7.36E-10,7.08E-11,1.85E-07,0.010706958,1.85E-08,3.29E-10,0.9999647,9.33E-08,2.89E-14,4.08E-13,2.79E-15,4.81E-05,1.75E-06,7.95E-14,0.004094522,5.62E-09,1.53E-12,1.14E-07,2.84E-15,1.82E-06,2.47E-11,3.64E-07,3.58E-05,4.19E-06,5.07E-07,3.72E-05,0.9999678,1.15E-05,2.58E-06,3.09E-08,8.87E-09,5.31E-07,3.95E-08,6.68E-07,0.998376,2.85E-09,3.27E-10,1.40E-05,8.24E-08,3.70E-06,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

tt18566042,Shackleton's Endurance: The Lost Ice Ship Found,Documentary,,Laurence Fishburne,"Following the March 9, 2022 news announcement of the history-making discovery of Shackleton's ship, Endurance, this documentary serves as a definitive look at Sir Ernest Shackleton's historic and ill-fated 1914 Antarctic expedition resulting in the loss of his highly revered ship, as well as maritime archaeologists' mission to find this ""holy grail"" of shipwrecks. This 90-minute special will serve as a continuation of the network's commitment to telling the complete Shackleton story following the previously aired ""Endurance: The Hunt for Shackleton's Ice Ship"" which chronicled the first, ground-breaking expedition to locate the lost ship by the same leadership team on the same vessel in 2019. The two-hour documentary, which originally aired on November 28, 2020 as part of the series ""History's Greatest Mysteries,"" was the result of two years of planning and over $250 million spent in technology utilizing the same vessel, the S.A. Agulhas II. Many of the same crew were aboard when their news made international headlines when they discovered the ship on the bottom of the Weddell Sea.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjUyMDE0OTktODRiNi00MzgyLThhYWItYjU4YTk4MjA5MGJhXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,Documentary,Documentary,Documentary,Documentary,1.74E-07,1.86E-05,3.94E-05,0.000170073,7.19E-09,0.011874748,0.99985313,0.000297713,3.86E-05,2.21E-08,1.87E-08,0.025487877,4.58E-06,0.013847588,0.037192896,4.69E-06,1.35E-10,0.002647042,3.52E-06,5.44E-05,0.001736503,0.014665487,0.003487972,0.2780856,0.003651748,0.010940346,0.99153125,0.0618485,0.012631644,0.001523548,0.001441361,0.42138004,0.011188066,0.005675753,0.050354715,0.002542653,0.001750732,0.00221439,0.007136415,0.005176934,2.83E-08,1.21E-05,3.16E-12,4.61E-05,9.98E-12,6.50E-06,0.999984,3.11E-08,2.04E-08,9.62E-15,2.57E-15,0.21685673,4.45E-07,0.018723587,0.001702867,4.55E-11,1.28E-16,1.21E-06,4.58E-10,7.19E-08,2.10E-09,0.000113042,5.56E-05,2.22E-05,4.42E-06,2.60E-06,0.9999995,3.80E-06,5.06E-06,6.17E-08,3.14E-08,3.52E-07,2.64E-07,9.22E-07,3.59E-06,4.81E-08,9.02E-10,0.001350485,3.94E-07,1.82E-06,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

A seemingly basic question demanding an intangible answer! For the first time, ""Fatherhood 101"" will reveal to audiences everywhere the Pandora box of fatherhood. Fatherhood 101 is a feature documentary exploring the meaning of fatherhood by unveiling a multitude of compelling fatherhood philosophies. Follow fathers from all sociocultural backgrounds, including celebrity fathers such as Alan Thicke, Lee Daniels, Tyrese Gibson, Edward James Olmos, Christopher McDonald, Emilio Rivera, Lance Henriksen, Grant Hill, Robert Davi, and Rick Faungo in revealing an intimate side of themselves, by sharing not only touching childhood anecdotes involving their own fathers but also the love, hardship and selflessness they continuously give and combat as parents. With the support of riveting statistics of hope and expert testimonials from agencies, case workers and law makers, the film examines the dissension between the vital role of fathers in children's development and current fatherhood landscape.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk3OTUyNDk4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDQ4OTYxOA@@._V1_.jpg,"Documentary, History",Documentary,"Biography, Documentary, News",Documentary,1.87E-06,0.003033463,0.000175605,0.07215541,2.01E-05,0.06352228,0.99987996,0.23960802,0.000166855,2.96E-07,1.79E-06,0.5232731,0.000205112,0.016861262,0.33548406,6.98E-05,3.19E-07,0.00338152,2.05E-05,1.07E-05,0.00059022,0.007218791,0.001726336,0.03740976,0.02199348,0.005724233,0.9913611,0.035174076,0.012819978,0.000636088,0.000814114,0.036235496,0.004690742,0.001445177,0.061106883,0.003455697,0.000938212,0.000630742,0.000840707,0.007348766,8.00E-07,1.60E-07,4.35E-10,0.5686369,5.11E-07,0.000240427,0.9999362,0.012862876,2.59E-07,2.34E-11,7.52E-12,0.010598403,2.17E-07,3.18E-07,0.85661554,7.54E-10,7.33E-09,2.54E-06,7.87E-11,1.32E-05,1.61E-10,2.42E-05,0.00011603,4.15E-07,3.94E-07,4.47E-07,0.9999999,1.37E-07,1.08E-06,3.84E-09,1.43E-08,1.60E-08,1.00E-07,7.83E-07,2.52E-07,1.87E-08,9.08E-11,0.001858693,4.71E-08,1.94E-07,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

tt7074246,Work & Happiness: The Human Cost of Welfare,Documentary,Erin Mae Miller,"Arthur C. Brooks, Robert Doar, Nazerine Griffin Jr., Harriet McDonald, Charles Alan Murray","Compassion fueled the creation of America's welfare system, a safety net that rescues some of the most vulnerable among us. We often hear political leaders and activists tout the system's good intentions, but what about those living on welfare? Do they think the system is working? Have good intentions delivered good results? The safety net is ideally more of a trampoline, where people hit it and then bounce back onto their feet, and into rich, fulfilling lives. But today, instead of bouncing back, too many Americans have become ensnared in the net. Of course, the system has helped some people, but the sad fact is that it typically hurts those it's supposed to help. Viewers will experience the welfare system through the eyes of those who are stuck in it.

He has documented how modern cities repel human interaction, and argues that we can build cities in a way, which takes human needs for inclusion and intimacy into account.

Still, Josh Petersdorf, Elizabeth Still, Patrick Collins, Francois de Siebenthal","This film is about the greatest rip-off in history - the very way money and debt are created and controlled. This affects everyone on the planet, and is the basic cause of all of our economic problems today. Until we all recognize this - in every nation - there is nothing any national government does will fix the problem, and all of us will see mounting debts and sinking standards of living. Our children will inherit this mess, and it will get worse every single year. The truth is that depressions are NOT normal. They are contrived. The truth is that nations don't need a national debt. The truth is that nations don't have to borrow. Why would you borrow when you can create the money you need? The truth is that governments generally aren't PRINTING money wildly; governments are BORROWING money wildly. The good news is we CAN fix this. It won't take a war or a revolution; it only takes a simple understanding of the problem, and its simple solution. The truth is that ANYONE can understand what's going on. This is not rocket science.

tt1651906,Mzungu (n.) White-Wanderer,"Adventure, Documentary, Drama",Shane Gilbert,"Shane Gilbert, Daniel Adams, Eric Byington, Scott Byington, Adam Welbon","This feature length documentary, Mzungu, is our story about personal change, sacrifice, adventure, and ultimately the power of love and community. You will embark on a journey into the great joys and perils of Africa through the eyes of four-young-naive and unassuming Americans. As we join Scott, Eric, Dan, and Adam on their crusade to 'save the world', you too may just fall in-love with Uganda and Rwanda, meet some new friends, and change your life for the better. These young men aren't on a vacation, they have gone to work hard, to 'help', doing what they know best. They will visit Internally Displaced People camps and witness the short and long term effects of genocide and tribal wars. They gain a new understanding of the immense devastation HIV/AIDS is creating across the continent of Africa.. But in the course of making life- long friends, as well as, facing the loss of life, the viewer is on this journey as well. We hope you will also laugh, cry, sing, dance, and in the end leave Africa completely different people. In a time when social entrepreneurs and global issues rule the media, this documentary is a truly raw and real look into a once-in-a-lifetime journey that turns into an entire world of friends working together. The power of this film lies in the questions it forces us to ask ourselves. Are we doing enough, what if it's too hard to help people, what does it mean to love people we've never met? Yet, in the end, you too will may start to believe the world can be a better place and that it is up to you to change it!",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjAyMzIyMjYxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjE3NTg0Mw@@._V1_.jpg,Documentary,Documentary,"Documentary, News","Adventure, Documentary, Drama",3.60E-07,0.000124145,0.000143314,8.35E-06,0.013880412,1.61E-07,0.99443567,0.000892375,0.00156394,5.89E-06,3.38E-05,8.60E-07,6.21E-06,1.51E-07,0.045796584,0.000552868,4.54E-06,0.00014034,7.83E-05,0.000596564,0.001278786,0.013369928,0.004593798,0.121008135,0.012542659,0.00981813,0.9953603,0.15297289,0.03368663,0.001139282,0.001215937,0.04775544,0.007015458,0.003202851,0.035546973,0.004228089,0.001418762,0.001456157,0.003027341,0.00323327,6.21E-06,0.015315778,9.08E-09,0.002495806,3.53E-06,8.05E-08,0.99988973,0.013596712,0.001774486,1.63E-11,1.04E-09,2.45E-05,1.67E-06,2.14E-07,0.59154385,1.46E-07,5.54E-09,1.42E-06,0.000276561,1.25E-05,4.61E-08,0.9999578,1.68E-09,9.86E-05,2.24E-06,1.75E-07,0.99999535,0.99982375,5.81E-06,9.12E-09,2.02E-08,2.16E-08,5.28E-11,1.20E-11,2.95E-10,4.62E-06,2.24E-06,1.09E-08,3.93E-11,8.28E-13,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

All the struggles she had faced growing up became clear, and Christine started to look at things from a new perspective and begin to make sense of who she really is. There are thousands of women in the UK, just like Christine, who have been battling with undiagnosed autism for decades, and now Christine is looking for answers. Why did it take so long before she received a diagnosis? What impact has this had on her life? How many other women out there have been let down too?

Throughout the summer of 1956, Steve Allen was the only host. When Allen's prime-time series debuted in the summer of 1956, he limited his appearances on this show to Wednesday through Friday and a series of guest hosts filled in until 1 October 1956 when Ernie Kovacs took over as permanent host for the Monday and Tuesday broadcast.

Guy uncovers an extraordinary World War II tale involving forced conscription into the German army and witnesses a full scale battle re-enactment. Guy's trip finishes with an emotional reunion with his long lost Latvian cousins. The journey won't just help paint a picture about his grandfather's life, but it will also provide some answers about the origins of Guy's own unique personality.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGM1M2Q1YTEtODJkZS00MTYwLWE4NTUtYjQwYWU1ZTFkNzdmXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,Documentary,Documentary,Documentary,Documentary,2.82E-05,0.004618944,0.000751548,0.006753656,0.003504984,7.78E-05,0.9816558,0.022535093,0.011499365,0.000185314,0.000129726,0.003046421,5.10E-05,9.02E-05,0.2540943,0.00029028,8.99E-06,0.002134083,0.000406035,0.001916879,0.000916923,0.005823261,0.003487431,0.21601023,0.12904125,0.007646284,0.99026746,0.094377354,0.016346192,0.000929717,0.000634326,0.036062207,0.004897747,0.002168783,0.00897571,0.002027792,0.001645967,0.001096583,0.001560233,0.003929251,1.89E-05,0.011608441,4.06E-06,0.015894856,5.20E-07,4.39E-06,0.9999083,4.49E-05,0.000218064,9.38E-09,1.10E-10,0.009478033,3.23E-07,0.000149304,0.001196078,4.20E-07,9.55E-10,4.76E-05,0.000737906,2.35E-05,1.61E-09,1.27E-05,1.28E-05,3.02E-06,2.32E-06,8.60E-07,0.9999993,2.45E-07,1.49E-06,3.04E-08,1.79E-08,1.87E-05,1.32E-07,3.68E-06,1.80E-07,1.33E-07,1.77E-10,0.001720526,2.46E-07,1.89E-07,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

tt0360246,Beat for Beat,"Game-Show, Music",Kasper Mærli,"Trond Nagell Dahl, Ivar Dyrhaug, Gisle Børge Styve, Lars Andreas Aspesæter, Atle Pettersen","Beat for Beat is a Norwegian musical ""game show"". 4 guest singers in groups of two, usually Norwegian, but sometimes well known Swedish or Danish singers also, join the two regular pianists and the very quirky host Ivar. There are several rounds involved, the first starting with phrases from songs hidden behind numbers. The guests pick a number, and then a word behind the number is displayed. The guest then has to sing a song (any song he/she wants) with that word in it. As more numbers are displayed, the phrase hidden behind the numbers eventually becomes obvious, and the point is won when they sing the song with that phrase. Other rounds involve guessing songs the band plays, then there's a freestyle round at the end where the artists run up to the stage as soon as they recognize a song. Rules are never enforced strictly in the show, so the singer guests frequently ""steal"" others' songs and points, all in good fun. Very entertaining, and the musical knowledge of everyone is impressive as they have to play songs out of the blue quite a bit.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTBjMDdmMTUtOTBlNi00ZWQwLWIzMTktMjJkOTJlODQxZDYzXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,Game-Show,Game-Show,Game-Show,"Game-Show, Music",3.71E-06,1.57E-06,7.72E-09,1.37E-07,0.000534549,5.32E-07,0.004933475,2.61E-08,0.000206152,1.48E-07,0.9925487,1.52E-07,0.002302467,2.18E-07,2.42E-05,0.45872828,3.26E-05,2.85E-07,6.67E-07,0.000197504,0.011291779,0.03032146,0.010445422,0.009725321,0.30775687,0.004159189,0.017909704,0.017030327,0.1265201,0.01129492,0.9667058,0.008134791,0.14991464,0.006722875,0.013172663,0.10064937,0.020425124,0.005912058,0.008005796,0.02911752,1.77E-05,8.02E-09,1.36E-10,2.10E-09,0.015883502,2.20E-12,3.83E-07,1.70E-11,0.14519462,4.61E-11,0.999383,2.87E-10,0.19350085,4.52E-11,7.40E-07,0.001379788,2.70E-09,6.43E-13,6.74E-08,0.000321482,8.12E-06,6.04E-08,3.34E-08,3.77E-08,0.000226595,2.49E-12,0.001171477,9.65E-12,3.13E-05,3.72E-09,0.9999976,9.15E-11,0.9994369,3.10E-11,1.89E-07,9.14E-05,6.89E-07,7.31E-08,1.07E-06,3.94E-06,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

tt1946442,The Karen: Forgotten But Not Forsaken,"Documentary, News",Michael Jones,Kirk Cameron,"The Karen are the oldest and largest indigenous tribe in Burma (Myanmar). They are being systematically exterminated, in a merciless campaign of ethnic cleansing by a brutal dictatorship intent on seizing their tribal lands. Over 500,000 Karen civilians have died during this conflict, and millions have been forced to flee across the river to Thailand. The recent 'elections' in Burma have only intensified government attacks, bringing a new flood of refugees into already overcrowded camps on the Thai border. Director Michael Jones traveled to Southeast Asia with Patrick Klein, founder of Vision Beyond Borders, a Christian relief ministry helping the Karen refugees.

Before the ink was dry on this free trade agreement, China began flooding U.S. markets with illegally subsidized exports while the big multinational companies that had lobbied heavily for the agreement rapidly accelerated the off shoring of American jobs to China. Today, as a result of the biggest shell game in American history, China has stolen millions of our jobs, corporate profits are soaring, and we now owe over $3 trillion to the world's largest totalitarian nation.

It's now time for some divas action as Paige takes on the defending WWE Divas champion, Charlotte, with her father, WWE Hall of Famer, Ric Flair, in her corner. Now it's time for the main event, where WWE World Heavyweight Champion defends his title against Roman Reigns in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match. Can Roman overcome the League of Nations and the Authority? Or will Sheamus walk out with his championship?",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2Q5NjJkNTMtNGEwMS00ZTY4LWJlNGQtNDBhNWIyZWU5MWMxXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,"Action, Sport","Action, Sport","Action, Sport","Action, Sport",0.8698034,3.65E-05,1.26E-07,1.01E-05,3.14E-05,2.85E-09,4.39E-06,7.53E-08,8.48E-07,8.02E-07,1.08E-06,1.40E-10,1.33E-07,1.97E-09,1.53E-08,1.50E-05,1.94E-10,3.46E-11,0.99999774,3.65E-06,0.7021717,0.004461261,0.004704834,0.011881252,0.01016737,0.00595404,0.016588176,0.01059219,0.011830338,0.002976129,0.012900019,0.008289293,0.004536099,0.003864716,0.015012033,0.013446935,0.005452501,0.001996802,0.9921319,0.009760667,0.858715,3.19E-23,5.38E-31,4.93E-25,1.71E-14,4.63E-28,1.95E-17,8.96E-28,4.21E-24,3.13E-29,1.00E-15,1.01E-20,3.83E-11,5.92E-22,8.87E-20,2.35E-20,9.32E-31,1.53E-20,1,1.06E-07,0.7078245,1.80E-06,1.07E-05,1.89E-06,2.30E-06,1.04E-10,5.03E-05,1.50E-11,1.84E-08,5.33E-07,8.56E-06,1.97E-09,1.08E-08,3.48E-10,1.97E-07,5.06E-06,3.62E-09,9.67E-05,0.99999464,6.98E-06,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE

They speak of the the locations acting as a third cast member, the other two being the human actors and animal actors. Some of the locations themselves are shown and the crew members involved discuss why they were chosen. They speak of the logistics, not only in transforming them to authentic to the 1930s and 1940s when the show is set, but in making the transitions as seamless as possible in reality not always matching what is shown in the show, in being as unobtrusive as possible to the residents who still have to lead their daily lives through filming, and challenges of that actual reality, such as driving on many of the countryside one track roadways. Special mention is made of transportation infrastructure as they relate to the show, from those one track roadways, to the authentic period automobiles, to footpaths the characters often are seen using, and which the cast and crew often walk during their off hours, to the railway stations used in key scenes.

Like the legends who were born out of smokey, booze-soaked nightclubs of decades past, Doug Stanhope spews his own brand of moral outrage in an unmatched style that borders on self-destruction. Nothing is sacred, no subject off-limits and most importantly nothing is contrived. From critically acclaimed appearances at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival to regular appearances on The Howard Stern Show, Stanhope always shows an intelligence and brutal honesty in his comedy, no matter how viciously graphic or unsettling the material may be. Taped live at the Gotham Comedy Club, this appearance is an unflinching look at one of the few voices left standing in the dark, punk-rock underbelly of stand-up comedy.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODYxMzcwNDM2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDg5MTA2MDE@._V1_.jpg,"Biography, Documentary","Comedy, Documentary","Comedy, Documentary","Comedy, Documentary",7.14E-05,2.02E-05,0.000259296,0.9337223,0.05507425,0.000185305,0.9956376,0.000173596,8.61E-06,7.74E-05,1.92E-05,0.006533997,0.002045207,5.51E-06,0.008792069,2.85E-05,1.16E-07,1.26E-05,0.007089927,0.00356686,0.00141933,0.006313602,0.005874652,0.059252262,0.9129656,0.006737474,0.9677411,0.029087638,0.026435347,0.002387865,0.002048879,0.009887164,0.015967198,0.00247854,0.008127933,0.004591786,0.004429579,0.001389129,0.001555995,0.014875663,7.29E-13,1.04E-18,8.24E-20,1.72E-06,0.99999726,3.05E-12,0.9999589,1.54E-12,3.36E-17,5.22E-22,6.55E-14,3.39E-15,9.56E-11,1.64E-19,4.03E-07,3.70E-09,3.16E-13,3.74E-15,4.18E-17,1.84E-07,3.46E-08,2.27E-06,2.75E-05,9.37E-06,0.9999535,5.68E-07,0.9999988,2.57E-08,3.38E-07,2.08E-06,6.37E-09,2.48E-08,2.42E-06,5.83E-10,3.94E-09,6.03E-10,1.33E-08,1.47E-06,4.42E-08,2.27E-08,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

tt0396813,Pobeda kitayskogo naroda,"Documentary, History","Ivan Lukinsky, Leonid Varlamov","Leonid Khmara, Kai-Shek Chiang, Madame Chiang, Zedong Mao, Joseph Stalin","This color documentary account of the Communist conquest of China begins in 1929 (all archive footage) when Mao Zedong and his small army held only a few cities in the northern part of China. The band of revolutionaries increased when the poverty-stricken citizens joined the Communist ranks in a response to promises of land reforms and relief. When Japan attacked the country in 1937, it was Mao's Communist army which took the brunt of the defense fighting with ancient weapons. When World War II ended, the Communists began their surge to take over China. All the important cities fell to the rebels.

The Kuomintang in time was pushed to the border of Vietnam and victory went to Mao while the remnants of Chiang's army escaped to the island of Formosa.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzdhNTc0MDMtM2U3Yi00MTU3LTk2NGYtMGQ3YjZlOTllM2Y1XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,"Documentary, History","Documentary, History","Documentary, History","Documentary, History",1.04E-07,5.33E-06,0.000225911,0.03608343,9.06E-06,0.02474054,0.99881953,0.014985736,0.000834548,2.20E-07,7.35E-07,0.8121927,2.22E-08,0.001000947,0.025399541,7.53E-08,1.12E-09,2.23E-05,1.75E-07,6.65E-07,0.002119103,0.027393566,0.006783146,0.16735138,0.006318815,0.027038587,0.9933335,0.12870362,0.022325234,0.002937018,0.002114353,0.72265804,0.013698669,0.011884891,0.15440685,0.003458819,0.004481172,0.00426014,0.003968342,0.008007485,3.60E-05,2.88E-05,4.80E-10,0.007915619,1.98E-09,9.57E-06,0.9999522,0.012140191,5.83E-07,4.34E-11,2.66E-09,0.9856586,8.40E-07,4.83E-05,0.01841808,1.55E-08,2.04E-11,3.35E-08,1.12E-06,7.49E-06,7.34E-09,6.28E-06,8.71E-08,0.001153071,4.39E-07,4.92E-05,0.99999464,0.000123063,6.02E-07,2.15E-08,2.37E-09,0.99997866,7.31E-07,0.000414429,1.77E-05,4.97E-07,3.58E-10,5.74E-05,1.16E-06,8.30E-09,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

tt0803890,Stealing a Nation,"Documentary, History","John Pilger, Sean Crotty",John Pilger,"This tells a story literally 'hidden from history'. In the 1960s and 70s, British governments, conspiring with American officials, tricked into leaving, then expelled the entire population of the Chagos islands in the Indian Ocean. The aim was to give the principal island of this Crown Colony, Diego Garcia, to the Americans who wanted it as a major military base. Indeed, from Diego Garcia US planes have since bombed Afghanistan and Iraq. The story is told by islanders who were dumped in the slums of Mauritius and in the words of the British officials who left a 'paper trail' of what the International Criminal Court now describes as 'a crime against humanity' .",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTNiOTA1MDktN2ZhMy00ODNhLTk2OWMtMjU0MjIwNWZjNGFiXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,"Documentary, News","Documentary, History",Documentary,"Documentary, History",1.29E-06,2.44E-05,2.68E-05,0.001062747,6.70E-06,0.001362024,0.99398166,0.000119476,2.34E-05,9.85E-07,4.25E-07,0.003492289,2.25E-06,0.000331743,0.75011003,0.000161559,3.71E-09,0.001484031,1.94E-05,0.002083211,0.002725064,0.040141784,0.008093114,0.11689182,0.003509047,0.1009555,0.994307,0.14301224,0.023043768,0.003450644,0.003213166,0.6848149,0.009664981,0.019048337,0.16295695,0.005725275,0.005502394,0.005432943,0.005280868,0.007935622,2.29E-08,0.000105323,2.35E-09,2.20E-05,1.77E-08,0.001997492,0.9999895,0.050021842,1.62E-08,8.74E-11,2.49E-10,0.002754666,8.15E-11,6.27E-07,0.2937755,2.12E-07,3.92E-12,1.29E-06,2.88E-14,8.33E-09,1.04E-09,3.26E-06,8.83E-07,3.10E-05,1.83E-06,1.18E-05,0.9999999,9.56E-06,3.01E-07,2.46E-08,2.04E-09,0.9998697,7.45E-07,0.000749229,4.32E-06,4.73E-08,4.47E-11,0.000386738,1.79E-07,5.62E-09,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

In a unique collaboration with the British Natural History Museum, this landmark series presented by Nick Baker takes us to some of the most remote and inhospitable corners of the globe in order to find the ugliest, slimiest and downright bizarre animals that grace the planet. These are the animals that Nick Baker has been longing to track down ever since his childhood days when he was ''dumped'' at the world-class repository of zoological wonders, the British Natural History Museum in South Kensington.

Sooner or later it will all be gone."" In her directorial debut, award-winning filmmaker Kalyanee Mam travels to her native homeland to capture the stories of three young Cambodians struggling to maintain their traditional way of life while the modern world closes in around them. Deep in the jungle, Sav Samourn struggles as large companies encroach and ""progress"" claims the life-giving forests. She discovers there's little room for wild animals, ghosts - and the home she has always known. In a fishing hamlet, Sari Math must quit school to help support his family. But as the fish catch dwindles, Sari and his family find their livelihood threatened. In a village, Khieu Mok must leave to seek work in a Phnom Penh factory to help pay her family's debts. But city life proves no better, and Khieu struggles between her need to send money home and her duty to be with her loved ones. From Cambodia's forests to its rivers, from its idyllic rice fields to the capital's pulsing heart, forces of radical change are transforming the landscape of the country - and the dreams of its people.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA3MTc2NTQ4NDNeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDE5MDg3NzAx._V1_.jpg,"Documentary, Drama",Documentary,"Adventure, Documentary","Documentary, Drama",9.90E-05,0.038895793,0.002982087,0.20870797,0.04172903,0.001195906,0.99113375,0.6519881,0.12558529,0.001183782,0.000298148,0.014867846,0.000694955,0.000703527,0.02833756,0.000655316,0.000543763,0.002593685,0.00074187,0.000272889,0.001555115,0.025630446,0.005832452,0.036874637,0.005857159,0.019900877,0.99336994,0.110297516,0.03743722,0.001860388,0.001756334,0.10448261,0.007308931,0.004081963,0.15067437,0.006715612,0.002436777,0.002223942,0.00379356,0.005909293,7.63E-08,0.68603164,7.83E-11,0.001136945,5.82E-09,5.73E-05,0.99999964,0.48381138,0.000146356,2.27E-13,4.82E-12,1.51E-05,1.24E-09,8.69E-08,3.26E-05,1.66E-08,4.87E-11,9.61E-09,3.72E-08,6.83E-10,1.51E-12,0.000165061,6.70E-09,6.37E-06,8.19E-07,2.95E-05,1,0.9992938,9.65E-06,2.39E-10,1.98E-10,7.12E-08,1.52E-10,4.38E-08,2.45E-06,8.86E-09,3.88E-09,7.81E-07,8.24E-10,5.58E-09,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

tt0392948,Wife Swap,"Family, Reality-TV","Bridget Deane, Tanya Shaw, Stephen O'Leary, Tom Peppiatt, Stephen Pain","Samantha Fox, Olivia Williams, Ken Lorimer, Jade Goody, Jeff Brazier","During the first week of this reality series, the new wife must adhere to exactly the same rules and lifestyle of the wife she is replacing. Each wife leaves behind a house manual which explains her role in the family and the duties she holds. This almost always determines what rules the wives will apply at the ""rules change ceremony"". During the second week, the new wives are allowed to establish their own rules, and their new families must adhere to these new household rules. It usually takes a while for the families to adjust to this policy, meanwhile the wives disburse a sum of money to the family they have become involved with, to do what the wives see fit to spend it on. At the end of the two weeks, the two couples all meet together for the first time, and the wives, along with their husbands, discuss how they felt about the two weeks. This often descends into personal insults and has degenerated into violence at least twice. More often than not, however, both families reach toward a middle ground and express that they have learned from the experience. Sometimes, the table meeting is a very heartfelt and emotional time for the two families who sometimes have complete and mutual respect for each other. A few weeks later, the cameras return to record what changes have occurred since the wife swap.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzMzZGJiNTYtOGM3Ni00OWQ3LWE1NTYtZGU2NjU4OTU2OTgyXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,,Reality-TV,,"Family, Reality-TV",7.59E-06,5.37E-05,2.92E-06,0.004512716,0.014412948,0.000314645,0.4029702,0.011506631,2.41E-05,1.15E-05,1.98E-05,1.15E-05,2.15E-06,5.71E-06,6.41E-07,0.3582422,0.000333512,1.04E-06,1.89E-05,5.32E-08,0.005640347,0.014835606,0.002807891,0.004496059,0.023834031,0.004805174,0.050424777,0.013198393,0.012313904,0.00157984,0.041458804,0.002573907,0.005709319,0.001453778,0.013549079,0.915621,0.027786134,0.001521847,0.0089189,0.019948808,7.23E-05,1.67E-09,2.23E-07,0.000458678,0.077162914,2.05E-05,0.1233623,0.000374243,4.40E-06,1.89E-05,2.48E-06,1.26E-08,3.58E-09,8.32E-10,1.61E-06,0.2909136,0.000887291,1.46E-06,1.27E-06,1.23E-05,2.10E-06,1.23E-06,6.04E-11,1.14E-06,9.03E-05,7.78E-06,0.000907015,0.000319481,0.99872273,6.58E-05,1.84E-07,1.46E-06,4.24E-07,7.13E-07,8.71E-06,0.9998512,1.60E-05,1.87E-07,9.90E-07,1.84E-06,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Talbott, reviewed the case and Radulovich was reinstated. 24 November 1953: ""Argument in Indianapolis"" revealed how the local American Legion post refused to allow the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) to use their hall.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE1MjQ0ODMzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTczNjYzMQ@@._V1_.jpg,"Biography, Documentary","News, Talk-Show","Documentary, History, News","Documentary, News",1.09E-06,9.58E-06,9.16E-05,0.58683777,6.32E-05,0.000406319,0.9994898,0.000649903,5.32E-05,1.61E-06,5.92E-08,0.21621384,6.99E-05,3.01E-05,0.000530668,3.27E-09,1.04E-10,2.67E-06,0.000245993,3.59E-06,0.003029013,0.00607538,0.002542379,0.026227148,0.04221242,0.016258078,0.2700462,0.013693104,0.005972654,0.002327636,0.001643614,0.048678644,0.01191646,0.005401969,0.8229618,0.003430412,0.002059155,0.002926677,0.008994044,0.6650371,6.57E-05,7.38E-08,2.76E-07,0.009796394,6.56E-08,2.88E-07,0.99712807,0.000880212,3.53E-09,2.44E-09,4.65E-14,0.6849719,2.21E-07,2.72E-06,0.8394514,5.71E-11,7.77E-13,3.76E-07,1.30E-08,5.70E-05,1.11E-10,7.34E-07,1.60E-05,0.002671294,4.74E-06,0.000319522,0.9999927,9.30E-06,1.99E-06,1.53E-08,8.54E-10,5.23E-06,4.53E-07,2.61E-07,0.99853575,4.07E-10,3.76E-10,7.31E-06,9.84E-07,6.53E-06,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Some of that may be true, but those who work inside the bitter embrace of this dysfunctional family known as porn understand that the real story is both more mundane, and much more bizarre, than you could ever imagine.

Stephanie Preyde herself eloquently and unflinchingly narrates the film, describing the cumulative effects of the copious amounts of acid she took during that summer, the ongoing and Byzantine delusions which she suffered (Montreal as the lost City of Atlantis amongst others), the repudiation of her physical self, her eventual institutilization and journey to ""normalcy."" In this experimental documentary -- set to a trippy acid jazz score -- Preyde faces the ongoing repercussion of her trips: a possible misdiagnosis of bipolar disorder instead of temporary acid psychosis, and ironically, lifelong reliance on prescription meds.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzMyMWI5OTEtN2Q2Mi00YzA1LWFmYTctZTM1NmQwNGNhZTA5XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,Documentary,Documentary,Documentary,Documentary,3.65E-06,9.74E-06,6.82E-05,0.001795118,6.09E-05,0.007015326,0.9991667,7.08E-05,2.45E-06,2.65E-07,9.98E-06,0.010001807,0.002179371,0.001222701,0.000902831,0.001521945,4.06E-08,0.00011069,0.000136073,2.89E-05,0.001276655,0.009684145,0.003781918,0.12797768,0.01737757,0.010912322,0.99514765,0.13544421,0.020669885,0.000919219,0.000722815,0.04630685,0.006688339,0.002572591,0.028712168,0.002663805,0.001255734,0.001205465,0.002802817,0.004362604,1.81E-07,0.000611436,1.19E-06,0.02846687,3.51E-05,1.55E-05,0.9999976,0.024931977,4.56E-08,6.33E-10,1.67E-13,0.019335454,0.000322508,2.85E-07,0.000167239,1.96E-07,2.34E-10,4.30E-05,3.26E-11,5.93E-10,2.47E-11,1.38E-07,3.45E-06,1.26E-06,5.63E-07,0.00024202,0.99999785,3.26E-08,9.23E-09,4.04E-13,2.09E-11,1.32E-08,2.20E-08,2.05E-07,8.89E-07,2.65E-08,2.61E-11,1.02E-05,3.05E-07,6.17E-07,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

tt31888721,Cyclone Warriors,Documentary,Ian Richards,Greg Grainger,"Set against the backdrop of the lush tropical landscapes of northern Australia, ""Cyclone Warriors"" stands as a poignant tribute to the indomitable human spirit in the face of nature's wrath. As the 50th Anniversary of Cyclone Tracy approaches, this gripping documentary, adapted from Dr. Tom Lewis's acclaimed book, immerses viewers in the tumultuous aftermath of one of Australia's most devastating natural disasters.

Under the masterful direction of Ian Richards and presented by Logie Award-winning filmmaker Greg Grainger, ""Cyclone Warriors"" unfolds as a cinematic journey through the heartache and heroism that defined Darwin in the wake of Cyclone Tracy. With awe-inspiring detail, the film captures the relentless fury of the storm and the profound impact it had on both Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities.

Through a tapestry of intimate interviews, archival footage, and, ""Cyclone Warriors"" chronicles the herculean efforts of the Australian Defence Force, Police, and emergency aid services as they rallied to rescue and rebuild Darwin from the brink of destruction. Against a backdrop of sweltering heat and infrastructure-deprived chaos, these unsung heroes worked tirelessly to safeguard the shattered remnants of Darwin's once-vibrant community.

As the anniversary of Cyclone Tracy looms, Ian's portrayal of unsung heroism serves as a stark reminder of the immense sacrifices endured by those who faced nature's fury head-on. From the largest evacuation in Australia's history to the arduous task of rebuilding a city laid to waste, ""Cyclone Warriors"" bears witness to the unwavering resilience and courage of those who refused to be defeated.

Yet, amidst the harrowing tales of valour, a poignant question emerges-why have these courageous warriors not received the recognition they so rightfully deserve? Through Ian's lens, this question resonates with a haunting poignancy, compelling both Australian and international audiences to acknowledge and honour the bravery and sacrifice of those who rebuilt Darwin from its very foundations.

As the credits roll, ""Cyclone Warriors"" stands not only as a testament to the resilience of the human spirit but as a rallying cry for remembrance and justice. Through its compelling narrative and profound emotional resonance, the film ensures that the legacy of Cyclone Tracy's unsung heroes will endure for generations to come, their stories etched into the fabric of Australia's collective memory.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2UyMjY4ZjUtNTk5OC00MGExLTg3MTktNzYzODIwYTBhMDM3XkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,Documentary,Documentary,Documentary,Documentary,1.07E-06,5.98E-07,1.48E-05,3.37E-05,0.002214765,0.007550203,0.8659513,6.69E-06,1.65E-07,3.98E-07,0.000284183,0.000193394,0.001989089,6.85E-05,0.000207285,0.17689678,1.56E-06,4.90E-05,1.09E-06,0.002483798,0.001542755,0.020904725,0.003395203,0.021621909,0.003035176,0.008932566,0.9903812,0.057157747,0.02543891,0.001254798,0.001588693,0.06895154,0.007168437,0.002655871,0.16988626,0.007154367,0.001442257,0.001497747,0.005186137,0.004851999,3.76E-06,4.32E-08,1.20E-13,2.36E-06,2.39E-09,0.00170286,0.9992787,4.26E-05,8.33E-09,1.71E-14,4.05E-11,0.009636578,4.47E-06,8.65E-05,0.000101621,1.21E-08,2.62E-12,1.89E-10,4.48E-06,7.39E-09,1.26E-09,1.36E-05,0.00074474,8.20E-07,3.88E-06,2.31E-06,0.9999989,2.76E-07,2.74E-06,6.75E-08,7.89E-08,8.80E-08,4.47E-07,3.52E-06,4.14E-05,2.99E-08,3.11E-10,0.003922266,5.91E-07,5.18E-06,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

This year, construction of a new highway to China has begun in their roadless valley, and things are never going to be the same. Partially complete, the highway project will transform this roadless Himalayan valley permanently and open up a direct transport route between Nepal and China - bringing new challenges, new opportunities, and ultimately a new way of being to those who live along its path. This documentary film is a deep dive into a way of life that is in the midst of a slow and chaotic, yet inexorable transition.

tt0198224,Sale of the Century,"Family, Game-Show","James Marcione, Jerome Shaw","Jim Perry, Summer Bartholomew, Lou Mulford, Don Morrow, Jay Stewart","Updated version of the 1969-1974 NBC game show. Three contestants competed to answer trivia questions, with scoring in dollars. The game was interrupted at certain intervals for Instant Bargains, which allowed the player in the lead to buy a prize at a discounted prize (e.g., a $795 stereo color TV for $6), always at the risk of later losing the game; and a new feature, the ""Fame Game,"" where the host read first-person clues leading to the identity of a person, place, thing, etc., with the winner having a chance to earn cash, a bonus prize or add to his score with the choice of one of nine numbers. The player with the highest score could elect to use his score money to buy specially-discounted luxury items (e.g., a $4,500 diamond-studded Swiss watch for $120), or accumulate his score money by winning future games and having access to either a luxury car, an escalating jackpot which began at $50,000 and increased by $1,000 per show until won, or everything on stage. Later in the show's run, the endgame's format changed, where champions chose prizes via a matching game; and again later by solving phrases within 30 seconds to win a cash bonus.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWU2MTA5ZmItNTIxNC00YTY3LTg3N2ItNjE1MWQ0YTY1MDliXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,Documentary,Game-Show,"Family, Game-Show","Family, Game-Show",5.61E-06,3.15E-05,1.50E-05,2.73E-06,0.000269006,2.88E-05,0.86302936,3.98E-06,0.001562531,8.23E-07,0.26563078,0.09105899,0.000468889,0.000456812,0.000681225,0.005755177,8.47E-08,0.000116056,1.24E-06,5.59E-05,0.011872146,0.026896987,0.006332042,0.006326221,0.119161904,0.003950839,0.017961828,0.016943982,0.1299227,0.006609075,0.96012014,0.007985879,0.011134281,0.004503211,0.011083637,0.07121138,0.011457818,0.003762737,0.017961146,0.010363803,9.61E-07,3.04E-08,4.00E-13,2.14E-13,1.40E-05,7.49E-13,1.58E-07,1.44E-12,0.6960797,2.76E-14,1,1.36E-09,8.43E-06,5.82E-11,2.27E-10,4.74E-06,1.55E-12,4.58E-15,3.41E-12,4.25E-09,7.29E-06,1.14E-06,3.06E-09,1.98E-08,0.000142872,4.45E-11,0.000526174,2.09E-07,0.99988735,2.86E-06,0.9999547,1.98E-10,6.23E-07,1.97E-11,2.06E-06,5.83E-08,3.35E-08,1.88E-07,1.02E-06,6.87E-07,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

tt11356922,Alkohol,Documentary,Andreas Pichler,"David Nutt, Raphael Gaßmann, Harvey Milkman, Sarah Halpin, Paul Davies","Alcohol: No substance in the world seems so familiar to us and is so incredibly diverse in its effect. Alcohol is available everywhere and this particular molecule has the power to affect all 200 billion neurons of our human brain in completely different ways. But hardly anyone calls alcohol a drug despite its psychoactive and cell-destroying effect. Why do we tolerate the death of three million people every year? Have we turned a blind eye to the dangers and risks for thousands of years? What role does the powerful alcohol industry play with an annual turnover of 1.2 trillion euros in this on-going concealment? The author, who himself enjoys having a drink, looks into the question why we drink at all, what alcohol does to us and to what extent the alcohol industry influences society and politics. He travels around the world from Germany via England to Nigeria to detect aggressive trading practices of the global alcohol industry seeking growth in new markets at all costs. He also visits Iceland, which successfully made the turnaround: Where 20 years ago hordes of drunks roamed the streets, young people today master their need for relaxation and life stimulants without alcohol. The film has no intention to point a moral finger but nevertheless will significantly change the drinking habits of the viewer.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzcwZDVjZGMtYjJmNS00Yzk4LWI5ZmMtNmJmMWRkNWVjZjliXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,"Documentary, Drama",Documentary,Documentary,Documentary,9.26E-05,0.015366366,0.000715805,0.042851143,0.007022747,0.009579814,0.99704355,0.563796,0.000510858,1.67E-05,0.000237274,0.006091147,0.01231395,0.001458685,0.04010881,0.001040539,0.000354427,0.002526632,0.001285063,0.000144062,0.001185339,0.012979559,0.002496427,0.020251969,0.005383377,0.017476538,0.985472,0.03385649,0.014753643,0.001229066,0.001322985,0.08349669,0.005470289,0.003517385,0.39876845,0.004023701,0.001240677,0.001202753,0.001992084,0.014675751,1.51E-06,0.006965013,3.45E-05,0.000106305,2.15E-07,4.00E-08,0.9999982,0.03277212,1.78E-09,1.07E-11,9.32E-11,2.87E-06,1.18E-07,9.22E-12,0.060182165,2.31E-08,2.36E-10,1.22E-06,4.41E-11,6.95E-08,2.81E-10,3.15E-05,0.000167404,3.33E-06,3.06E-06,2.51E-06,1,2.61E-07,1.18E-06,4.61E-09,6.14E-09,8.13E-08,3.98E-07,1.20E-06,2.12E-06,8.03E-09,1.32E-10,0.001551069,2.00E-07,1.19E-07,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

tt0384161,Held Hostage in Colombia,Documentary,"Jorge Enrique Botero, Victoria Bruce, Karin Hayes",,"On February 12, 2003 a Pentagon-owned Cessna went down in the jungle of southern Colombia. At the crash site, guerillas from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), Colombia's largest insurgent group, surrounded the men as they emerged from the plane, and later shot and killed an American pilot and a Colombian crewmember. The three other Americans were captured as ""prisoners of war"" and are still being held hostage. With unprecedented access, Colombian journalist Jorge Enrique Botero obtained this exclusive interview with the three men in a jungle prison camp on July 25, 2003. Seen for the first time since their abduction, Thomas Howes, Marc Gonsalves and Keith Stansell, flanked by guerrilla soldiers with automatic weapons, reveal what daily life is like in captivity and express their fears that they will never leave Colombia alive. In emotional sequences, the hostages learn that their co-workers died trying to rescue them, and send heartbreaking messages to their loved ones. And in a dramatic confrontation caught on camera, a FARC commander becomes suspicious that they are operatives of the CIA, rather than civilian contractors. With expert testimony from academics and politicians, HELD HOSTAGE IN COLOMBIA also calls into question the long-running American drug policy in Colombia and the US government's response to terrorist acts around the world.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTRmNTA5ZjctOTI2YS00NzdjLTlmYmEtNGVlZDc2MDQwMTQzXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,Documentary,Documentary,"Documentary, News",Documentary,7.42E-06,0.002813564,0.000922699,0.023331199,2.82E-05,0.002861156,0.99989116,0.34780583,0.000999796,4.43E-07,5.81E-08,0.12357879,1.48E-05,0.000782076,0.46968874,1.10E-06,3.62E-08,0.000580689,0.000113465,2.85E-06,0.00133699,0.015129861,0.003785247,0.05032063,0.003449341,0.13744923,0.9934558,0.080441326,0.015453052,0.001407649,0.001539426,0.07152349,0.004558145,0.006312492,0.08431562,0.005956564,0.00137951,0.001302362,0.003421185,0.005664105,9.85E-07,0.000236007,5.55E-12,1.40E-05,6.17E-10,0.005733652,0.99998975,0.001053192,8.84E-09,4.26E-11,1.65E-11,0.005178656,2.12E-08,1.14E-06,0.5405673,1.79E-08,1.92E-10,1.46E-08,7.87E-13,1.20E-09,6.06E-10,3.50E-05,0.000297062,2.41E-06,3.71E-06,2.68E-06,0.9999999,1.93E-07,1.32E-06,7.42E-09,2.83E-08,6.77E-08,3.72E-07,7.80E-07,3.04E-06,6.65E-09,1.50E-10,0.001372664,2.69E-07,2.00E-07,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

His widely publicized trial took place in 2004. Dutroux was convicted of all charges, along with the murder of a suspected former accomplice, and sentenced to life imprisonment. Dutroux's accomplices included Michelle Martin, Michel Lelièvre, Jean-Michel Nihoul, and Bernard Weinstein. Martin was convicted and sentenced as an accomplice to 30 years in prison, while Lelièvre was sentenced to 25 years. Nihoul, a Brussels conman, pub-owner and familiar face at sex parties, was initially tried as an accomplice to the kidnappings, but was acquitted of these charges due to insufficient evidence. He was instead convicted of involvement in a gang that participated in human and drug trafficking and was sentenced to five years in prison.

tt34691249,Strictly Amy: Cancer and Me,Documentary,Jaclyn Parry,Amy Dowden,"In May 2023, Strictly Come Dancing professional Amy Dowden was given the earth-shattering news she had breast cancer. In an instant, life was put on hold and thrown into uncertainty. It was the day before her honeymoon when she discovered a lump, and shortly after, her fears were confirmed. She and her husband Ben had hopes to one day start a family. Later that year, she had been due to return to Strictly - a show she had dreamed of being part of since she was a girl. Instead, she faced the most turbulent year of her life and a battle for her health, fertility, and to dance again. This deeply personal documentary follows Amy from just six days after her diagnosis. She took the brave decision to share her experiences, whatever unfolded, in the hope of helping others understand the reality of cancer at a young age. Amy never expected it would happen to her at 32. Less than a week after her diagnosis, Amy is reeling from the news. Ben, her parents and family rally around. It is a fearful time as scans reveal her cancer is grade 3, the most aggressive form. She undergoes a mastectomy and eight gruelling chemotherapy sessions. Strictly is no longer possible. She and Ben have to decide whether to undergo fertility treatment to try to preserve their hope of children in the future. Losing her hair is devastating for Amy, but she shows her mettle to find positives from the experience. After diagnosis, Amy fears she can't keep it secret for long. Sharing the story could help her control what was and wasn't in the public domain, especially at a time when she had little power over her own health. But it is still nerve-wracking when she posts about her diagnosis on social media. The overwhelming support encourages Amy to keep sharing her journey online. The downside is hurtful, negative comments when she was at her lowest - even in her hospital bed. But there are highs, like messages about how her decision not to wear a wig on Strictly had shown girls and boys going through chemo that bald is beautiful. Alongside family support, Amy's colleagues at Strictly do all they can to keep her included in the glittery world of the show that means everything to her. At the live final, Amy performs in a group routine with a broken foot, and the incredible response lifts her spirits. This powerfully candid film follows Amy through her toughest journey, as she pushes to return to health and back to the Strictly ballroom.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjE0MWFmZDYtNzYwMy00ZWMyLTgzYjMtZTc0ZTZhMzA4YzJhXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,"Documentary, Reality-TV",Documentary,Documentary,Documentary,4.93E-06,0.00046729,5.51E-08,0.000279945,9.87E-10,8.05E-06,0.6344794,3.84E-06,4.28E-06,3.65E-08,3.13E-05,4.00E-06,8.39E-06,2.75E-05,9.75E-05,0.8925324,7.55E-08,6.08E-05,0.000802737,5.99E-05,0.001491004,0.005943184,0.002532508,0.19405322,0.025456447,0.004486189,0.9885046,0.08740391,0.019954516,0.00066185,0.000813642,0.017946651,0.010400238,0.001996173,0.01190371,0.003454646,0.001115214,0.001020287,0.005627372,0.003886976,7.24E-06,0.000562184,1.78E-09,4.14E-05,4.04E-09,9.93E-10,0.92489356,7.06E-07,4.16E-07,3.11E-13,2.66E-09,1.39E-07,7.87E-07,1.52E-10,8.28E-05,0.001384829,9.35E-11,3.17E-08,0.008654906,1.76E-05,2.19E-09,0.000368211,4.11E-05,2.52E-06,2.34E-06,2.50E-07,0.9999999,1.31E-07,4.34E-07,7.79E-09,2.65E-08,2.11E-08,7.55E-07,2.29E-07,6.15E-09,2.40E-06,1.55E-10,0.004012726,7.07E-07,1.32E-07,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

tt11383990,Yo'eme Labyrinth,"Documentary, Drama",Sergi Pedro Ros,,"The documentary is about the difficulties that the Yaquis of Sonora (Mexico) face and their ancestral defense of the land and life in Mexico. Today they face a decisive battle.

tt1658027,The Afghan Solution,Documentary,Josie Maynard,"Jason Amerine, George W. Bush, James Dobbins, Abdul Rashid Dostum, Karl Eikenberry","THE AFGHAN SOLUTION: A gripping narrative filled with interviews from insiders that illustrates the value of revisiting the original US strategies to rout the Taliban in the days immediately following 9/11 in order to achieve success in Afghanistan today and examins the issues that are at the root of a failed nation-building experiment in Afghanistan. An insiders' account told firsthand by Afghan parliamentary members and citizens, warlords, NATO's ISAF brass, UN mediators, NGO personnel, American politicians, US Special Forces, and Taliban commander Mullah Jaffar - it is a tale that exposes rapidly changing strategies that failed due to lack of commitment with its disastrous results. The film puts forth that unless original strategies, enforced by significant policy change in the United States are put into place, the current state-of-play threatens to bring down the new democratic Afghan government, and see the war in Afghanistan that the US thought we won nine years ago, fully re-ignite and ensnare the country where we've spent nearly a decade trying to make viable; rendering the land of Afghanistan a base for terrorists' operations once again.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTMxYmU0MDAtNzU5NC00ODA5LWE2N2EtMmUwYjc3Y2Y0YzgxXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,Documentary,"Documentary, News","Documentary, History, News",Documentary,1.90E-08,6.15E-06,1.01E-05,0.001263425,3.29E-07,4.29E-06,0.9999777,6.04E-06,1.61E-06,2.38E-09,4.97E-08,0.11511221,3.64E-05,3.85E-05,0.005660145,3.58E-07,2.00E-12,3.97E-05,2.08E-06,1.43E-05,0.002320195,0.020791678,0.003964576,0.0858045,0.002532698,0.052420456,0.98525107,0.067974925,0.014714056,0.002011424,0.001564526,0.43892902,0.008224055,0.011118621,0.5627435,0.002975697,0.002526908,0.003495754,0.005029357,0.02674799,2.61E-06,1.78E-06,1.89E-11,0.003420938,3.18E-09,6.79E-06,0.9996942,0.000321839,8.76E-09,6.30E-13,7.15E-13,0.784539,3.91E-09,7.00E-06,0.85003525,3.34E-11,4.41E-13,2.62E-08,7.19E-10,6.29E-06,3.66E-10,2.44E-05,9.06E-05,4.20E-06,6.86E-07,6.57E-07,1,2.54E-07,6.22E-07,7.80E-09,1.37E-08,0.000101194,6.03E-07,5.27E-06,3.09E-06,1.10E-08,4.25E-11,0.003945879,4.03E-07,1.27E-07,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

The malady now has a name, chronic fatigue syndrome, and filmmaker Kim Snyder, who suffered from the disease for several years, tells her story and talks to victims and their families, and to physicians and researchers: is it viral, it is psychosomatic, is it one disease or several (a syndrome) ; what's the CDC doing about it; what's it like to have a disease that's not yet understood?

tt2346720,Corey Holcomb: Your Way Ain't Working,"Comedy, Documentary",Leslie Small,Corey Holcomb,"Get ready for a dose of reality - The Love Doctor is in, and starring in the hilarious new stand-up comedy special ""Corey Holcomb: Your Way Ain't Working"". Filmed live before a packed house at the Mandalay Bay Hotel & Casino, Las Vegas, this comedy event features Holcomb doing what he does best: offering spirited, opinionated advice about relationships gone awry. Holcomb is best likened to a perfect blend of legendary comedians, Redd Foxx and Richard Pryor, with a sprinkle of Rudy Ray Moore.

An exclusive interview with Manson Family member Patricia Krenwinkel reveals an unlikely relationship with charismatic Charles Manson that led her to cross every line of moral consciousness, culminating in the brutal murders she committed to win approval of the man she loved. Life After Manson offers a provocative character study that exposes a broken woman struggling with her past, her arduous effort to evaluate the cost of her choices, and the possibility of self-forgiveness. Can society offer her the same, and even identify with a woman who took life only to lose her own in a desperate effort to find love?",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA2MDAzODcwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjUwOTk1MTE@._V1_.jpg,"Biography, Documentary",Documentary,"Biography, Documentary","Crime, Documentary",5.88E-05,0.000975979,0.000144545,0.9758744,0.000299046,0.02291324,0.9991997,0.002882797,0.001080333,5.62E-05,4.14E-06,0.000114432,0.029479496,5.94E-05,0.000618963,6.77E-06,3.41E-07,2.32E-05,0.000446429,0.000525717,0.00309519,0.013762467,0.004864954,0.40659714,0.003822464,0.48155206,0.99148166,0.10804733,0.009805126,0.001551677,0.001184312,0.13983092,0.007525075,0.01572616,0.031186478,0.004160164,0.001922599,0.00223439,0.008712908,0.007080239,2.93E-09,6.28E-10,1.25E-11,0.946325,1.04E-10,0.47011542,0.99999964,0.00363223,6.28E-08,1.52E-13,2.50E-13,2.86E-07,6.26E-07,1.79E-08,0.000415746,8.16E-10,1.31E-09,1.65E-13,1.36E-10,5.73E-13,5.30E-12,3.12E-08,1.75E-07,0.015904376,1.19E-05,0.999977,0.9999999,5.62E-08,2.84E-08,2.68E-14,9.41E-14,4.07E-08,3.85E-08,2.47E-06,2.63E-06,9.31E-10,9.15E-11,5.43E-08,2.97E-08,4.94E-09,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

In the years after the reunification of the early 1990s, hatred, racism and violence against foreigners and supporters of leftist ideology broken out in Eastern Germany. Most of those involved was young people with no prospects and an uncertain future. In many cities and towns, the streets and squares belonged to the right-wing scene, organized in neo-Nazi comradeships with occasionally youth clubs as meeting points. Bomber jackets, combat boots and the Hitler salute showed the intimidated rest where they were. The baseball bat was a popular weapon. There were riots, attacks on asylum seekers' homes, mass brawls and hunt downs to those who looked or think differently. It doesn't took long and the first deaths were to be mourned. The majority of the Eastern German population looked the other way or even applauded the deeds. A bad omen for the political development of later years and the popularity of the AfD in this part of Germany today.

tt7376594,Urine Aid,Documentary,Steven Williams,"Moray Aitken, Andulairah, Anand Bapat, Canon James Brady, Rainer M. Engel","URINE AID is a rare look into the controversial world of urine therapy. With documentation dating back to the ancient Egyptian Eber's papyrus in 3000BC, urine therapy is one of the oldest forms of health care. Both fascinating and taboo, this documentary explores the confronting subject of drinking urine for medicinal purposes. Is the world of urine therapy just filled with strange eccentrics or does it hold the key to a better understanding of holistic wellness? In URINE AID we hear from real life survivors who have healed themselves of some of the most serious of illnesses, such as cancer and rheumatoid arthritis, solely with the practice of urine therapy. We also hear from highly regarded professionals in both modern and alternative medical fields from around the world who practice this therapy and share their research in a global collective network. Although urine therapy is discredited by modern medicine, URINE AID questions the commercial use of urea by cosmetics and pharmaceutical companies. This key ingredient is a by-product of urine which is used in a range of medications and beauty products. Does this global multi billion dollar industry already reap the rewards of urine therapy? By delving into topics such as religion, art, culture and war, URINE AID exposes the prevalence of urine use in every day society, and challenges viewers to question their own belief system around the use of urine in medicine and alternative therapies today.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGM5MDU4NTgtNjczNC00M2Q1LTgwN2YtNWUwYjM3YzkwMDUxXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,Documentary,Documentary,"Documentary, News",Documentary,2.67E-08,3.86E-07,7.58E-05,0.012956635,0.000383326,1.31E-05,0.99686134,0.001813145,1.21E-06,1.61E-07,1.88E-08,0.000115881,3.05E-05,8.57E-08,0.27923456,8.98E-07,1.66E-08,2.46E-05,2.85E-05,0.021399984,0.001513532,0.017693551,0.003370896,0.039986197,0.003679638,0.009658889,0.99386215,0.061499193,0.018745834,0.001156073,0.001268732,0.16482906,0.007650952,0.003387843,0.15246831,0.003766657,0.001438489,0.001574444,0.003927184,0.006260471,1.81E-09,6.27E-11,2.25E-09,2.23E-06,1.07E-11,7.50E-15,0.99999905,0.000248401,3.32E-13,1.84E-15,4.45E-15,3.20E-07,6.03E-12,2.97E-15,0.9615856,7.66E-14,2.51E-14,1.44E-09,3.81E-13,0.000887323,1.29E-09,6.56E-05,0.000172169,3.36E-06,2.33E-06,1.39E-06,0.99999976,2.73E-07,2.03E-06,1.77E-08,5.68E-08,6.72E-08,3.88E-07,1.23E-06,7.13E-07,6.83E-08,4.27E-10,0.002374869,3.23E-07,3.23E-07,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

tt1743243,The Forgotten Maggies,"Adventure, Documentary, Drama",Steven O'Riordan,,"The documentary focuses on the human rights aspect of the Magdalene Laundries and shows how State and Church colluded to remand and keep these women against their will. The film challenges the audience to look beyond the historical significance of these institutions and most importantly, focuses on the impact this experience had on the women in their daily lives once the laundries closed down. It asks the important questions of why and how these institutions were allowed to carry on until late 1996. It asks why these women never received a public apology or redress from either State or Church. As young people living in Ireland, we believe it is essential for this to be acknowledged equally with the industrial school, convent home, orphanage and other environments of abuse.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDkxNDZmNTgtZmExMC00YzAwLTllODYtMWNhYjRhMWExMWYwXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,Documentary,Documentary,Documentary,"Adventure, Documentary, Drama",3.40E-06,0.001425558,0.000398026,0.078956984,1.78E-06,0.000464322,0.99995863,0.00204857,0.000204005,1.32E-06,1.06E-07,0.004979623,4.60E-06,0.000271358,0.038664706,3.95E-07,1.67E-09,0.000646157,0.00022665,0.00010323,0.001974021,0.018419852,0.004536147,0.10690356,0.003148169,0.026349388,0.9936055,0.13247658,0.019357633,0.001668321,0.001537072,0.43793243,0.007545595,0.00813706,0.15026356,0.002934586,0.002311712,0.002441492,0.004480762,0.006801183,9.75E-13,9.66E-14,8.49E-13,1.09E-07,1.15E-18,5.22E-11,1,7.99E-09,3.54E-16,4.83E-18,2.01E-22,0.002173489,3.03E-18,3.31E-12,0.000149774,3.63E-19,6.93E-22,1.35E-12,5.13E-18,1.37E-11,1.82E-09,0.999874,4.65E-10,3.66E-05,3.84E-07,3.36E-08,0.9999999,0.9999187,4.15E-06,1.73E-09,2.62E-09,1.30E-06,1.63E-11,2.30E-11,3.37E-10,2.23E-07,1.05E-07,1.38E-08,1.01E-11,1.46E-13,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Title is shot entirely on the grounds of the Playboy Mansion, and includes some historic footage regarding the events that took place there. The Playmates explore the grounds, including: swimming in and sunning themselves beside the Grotto; roaming au naturel through Hef's private menagerie; playing a clothing-challenged game of tennis; relaxing with a full-body-massage and a hot shower; playing an impromptu game of strip poker; shooting pool, and celebrating good shots by disrobing; taking a nighttime dip in the Grotto; and engaging in a pillow fight, where the first casualties are their tiny outfits.

tt2366342,Forward 13: Waking Up the American Dream,"Documentary, News",Patrick Lovell,Patrick Lovell,"Caught in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, Patrick Lovell, one of 10 million people who lost their homes, finds himself asking why he and so many Americans were blindsided by the economy's implosion. How could his pursuit of the American Dream - starting a business, providing for his new family, and owning a home - drive him to financial ruin? Coinciding with the exponential growth of the Occupy Wall Street (OWS) movement, Lovell embarks on a cross-country journey to discover what happened to the America originally founded to be free from tyranny.

Survivors of this horrific crime tell their stories in this documentary feature film. It offers 3 goals. One: Let others know it is OK to come forward and get treatment. Two: Offer treatment alternatives. Three: Change the existing procedures to make reporting of these crimes safer for the survivors.

The film tells the story through eyes of the families of Port's victims, unpicking how the police failed to properly investigate each of the deaths in turn. The police's assumptions that these young gay men had died from self-inflicted overdoses of chem-sex drugs allowed Port to continue raping and killing innocent young men. The film unravels Port's sinister character and modus operandi. Port was motivated by a desire to satisfy his lust for abusive drug fuelled sexual encounters. He found all his victims through gay dating and social media sites, using multiple online profiles. Barking and Dagenham police's failings have led to huge anger amongst the families of Port's victims. Some have accused the police of institutional homophobia, and asked if officers would have investigated more thoroughly, had four young women turned up dead within such a small radius. The Met police have referred themselves to the Independent Police Complaints Commission over their handling of the case and will not comment on specific allegations until the IPCC investigation is complete.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDYyZTgyMjUtYjc0OC00ODk0LWE1ZGYtNWMyZmZhNzIzM2QzXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,"Crime, Documentary","Crime, Documentary","Crime, Documentary",Documentary,9.11E-12,4.58E-11,9.54E-07,4.01E-06,8.80E-07,0.87587005,0.99988997,4.66E-06,2.60E-07,3.46E-09,8.16E-10,3.85E-08,7.10E-11,1.23E-05,0.000216927,1.74E-09,2.10E-11,2.92E-07,6.13E-10,1.68E-06,0.004129245,0.012945132,0.008046071,0.1187833,0.008237516,0.82430303,0.96661705,0.06358364,0.010959288,0.00322029,0.00253836,0.042116113,0.004603837,0.023003971,0.05953268,0.010582875,0.003621026,0.00271528,0.01117106,0.015185125,1.82E-13,4.47E-18,3.71E-19,9.13E-08,1.07E-15,0.9930883,1,5.95E-10,4.07E-13,4.97E-18,9.32E-16,1.25E-08,2.10E-16,3.59E-06,3.87E-07,2.72E-15,8.45E-20,1.72E-16,5.68E-17,2.53E-14,8.73E-10,3.68E-06,0.000135849,1.68E-06,1.19E-05,0.00268259,0.9999987,4.49E-08,2.81E-07,3.87E-10,2.81E-09,1.01E-08,6.75E-08,1.23E-06,9.14E-07,2.74E-08,1.43E-10,0.000200561,2.16E-06,2.89E-07,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

tt10623932,UEFA Super Cup 2000,Sport,,"Galatasaray S.K., Real Madrid, Mircea Lucescu, Vicente del Bosque, Günter Benkö","Two goals from new signing Mário Jardel, including a 103rd minute golden goal winner, provided Galatasaray with their second UEFA trophy in three months as the Turkish side captured the UEFA Super Cup by defeating Real Madrid 2-1 at the Stade Louis II stadium in Monaco.

Until Jardel's winning strike, the match had been a tale of two penalties as Mário Jardel and Raúl both fired spot-kicks home for either side. The Turks took the lead in the 41st minute when Jardel beat Real goalkeeper Iker Casillas after Iván Campo was adjudged to have bundled over Hakan Ünsal inside the penalty area. But Real replied 11 minutes from full-time when Raúl drilled the ball past Cláudio Taffarel after Suat Kaya was ruled to have handled Sávio's attempted cross. However, Jardel, signed from Porto to replace the departed Hakan Sükür, enhanced his reputation even further when he turned home substitute Fatih Akyel's low cross from the right past Casillas from eight metres in extra-time, much to the delight of the assembled Turkish contingent.

Real Madrid, last season's UEFA Champions League winners, had the majority of both possession and scoring chances, but were unable to fashion a goal despite several attempts on goal by recent signing Luís Figo. The Spaniards, for whom Iván Helguera joined Iván Campo at the centre of their defence, offered more attacking threat from the kick-off, with Figo shooting narrowly over Taffarel's crossbar from 16 metres after Austrian official Günter Benkö decided to play advantage, despite the raised flag of his assistant in the 12th minute. Moments later, Figo again shot over from a free-kick after Guti had been upended 20 metres from goal. Galatasaray responded with a quick counter when Gheorghe Hagi nodded Taffarel's hurried clearance towards Jardel, but Campo hurried across to avert any danger.

Raúl then squandered Real's best chance of the half in the 16th minute with virtually his first touch of the match. Roberto Carlos swung in a low cross from midway inside the Galatasaray half that threaded its way to Raúl at the far post, but the Spanish international blazed over from close range. By now, Real were beginning to assume control, with Figo again lofting the ball over from a free-kick, Sávio testing Taffarel with a shot from an acute angle on the left, and Geremi heading a ball into the arms of Taffarel from Figo's corner, all in the space of three minutes.

The Turks, contesting the match as UEFA Cup holders, broke the siege in the 25th minute when Gheorghe Hagi's cross from the left found the head of Ümit Davala, but his effort sailed across goal without unduly troubling Iker Casillas. The move seemed to signal a Turkish revival with Hagi's rasping 25-metre drive palmed behind by Casillas in the 38th minute after the Romanian international was given the time and space to tee up his goal attempt from a worked free-kick. Hagi and Jardel then combined inside the penalty area to play in Okan Buruk, but his shot was charged down, as was Bülent Korkmaz's effort from the rebound before the Turkish side finally found the target.

Real's first goal attempt of the second half fell to Roberto Carlos, who swerved the ball into the arms of the waiting Taffarel from 30 metres after Okan was penalised for fouling Sávio. However, Galatasaray should have extended their lead in the 58th minute when Bülent volleyed the ball over the angle of post and bar from five metres when well-placed. Pedro Munitis, substituted in for the disappointing Guti, then helped to set up Raúl in the 63rd minute, but like Bülent moments before him, was guilty of a dreadful miss from seven metres as his effort failed to test Taffarel.

The Spaniards began to look more desperate to score as the match developed, with Claude Makelele unable to find the target after sidestepping a half-hearted challenge to shoot wide from 12 metres out, shortly before they were thrown a lifeline when Austrian official Benkö pointed to the spot. Raúl left nothing to chance as he drilled the ball past Taffarel for the equaliser.

Both sides attempted to avoid extra-time by throwing attackers forward in the final minutes with Suat Kaya and substitute Hasan Sas close for Galatasaray, while at the other end, Taffarel had to dive smartly to his left three minutes from time to turn Albert Celades' six-metre shot around the post following some good work by Pedro Munitis.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM1NDUyYTMtODI0Ni00OGVjLTk1MjYtZjZiZjM5NTViYjJkXkEyXkFqcGc@._V1_.jpg,Sport,Sport,Sport,Sport,0.00568632,1.96E-07,7.12E-09,2.56E-08,0.002646426,2.12E-12,1.88E-08,1.57E-07,0.00060408,9.82E-06,0.000231145,5.15E-12,7.24E-10,7.91E-12,2.47E-08,7.36E-06,9.90E-09,8.34E-14,0.99994874,6.61E-09,0.03657303,0.006228694,0.001809587,0.018369202,0.001686083,0.004663245,0.46796522,0.011111755,0.007492437,0.000971984,0.00678628,0.012991587,0.003845858,0.001783685,0.017128348,0.008214874,0.001366842,0.001000249,0.7910574,0.002312323,0.00265814,7.48E-20,8.39E-26,7.19E-14,3.24E-09,1.18E-17,3.00E-10,4.89E-14,2.23E-09,1.85E-17,9.58E-12,4.38E-15,3.90E-13,3.50E-11,1.28E-09,3.40E-13,2.94E-20,8.86E-18,1,3.32E-11,0.000480409,8.82E-08,7.51E-06,1.83E-05,2.48E-07,2.12E-08,0.029296571,8.54E-10,1.73E-08,3.92E-08,5.92E-07,4.67E-09,7.91E-08,1.01E-08,1.37E-05,2.87E-06,7.65E-10,0.000585299,0.9999957,0.000136723,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE
